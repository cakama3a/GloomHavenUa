COMPENDIUM_AttackModifiers_1,"When attacking, the base attack value written on the card can be modified by three types of values in the following order. These steps are repeated for each individual enemy targeted by the attack:<br><br>• An attacker’s attack modifiers are applied first. These modifiers include bonuses and penalties from active ability cards, items, and other sources (e.g., +1 Attack from Poison).<br><br>• Next, an attack modifier card is drawn from the attacker’s attack modifier deck and applied. This appears above the attack recipient's health bar as the attack is happening. The attack modifier cards can be seen by hovering over a character to show their information panel, with the blips next to each modifier showing how many remain in the deck.

COMPENDIUM_AttackModifiers_2,"• Lastly, the defender’s defensive bonuses are applied.

COMPENDIUM_GainingExperience_2,"Sometimes the action's text specifies that experience is only earned by consuming an elemental infusion by having it as part of the on-consume effect, or only if a certain condition is met (e.g. only if the attacked target is adjacent to one or more of the attacker’s allies) Some persistent active bonuses grant experience when a certain instance of that bonus' trigger condition is reached, as denoted by their accompanying tracker.

COMPENDIUM_MeleeAndRanged_1,"An <b>Attack X</b> ability allows a character to do a base X amount of damage to an enemy within their range. Characters and monsters cannot attack their allies. There are two types of attacks, Melee and Ranged:"
COMPENDIUM_MeleeAndRanged_2,"Melee attacks have no accompanying range value and are considered to have a default range of one hex, which means they typically target adjacent enemies."
COMPENDIUM_MeleeAndRanged_3,"Ranged attacks are accompanied by a <b>Range Y</b> value, which means any enemy within Y hexes can be targeted by the attack. Any ranged attack targeting an adjacent enemy gains Disadvantage against that target. (See <b>Advantage and Disadvantage</b>)"
COMPENDIUM_MeleeAndRanged_4,"All ranged and melee attacks can only be performed against enemies within line-of-sight, which means that a line can be drawn from any corner of the attacker’s hex to any corner of the defender’s hex without touching any part of a wall. Only walls block line-of-sight. In addition, any ability which specifies a range can only be performed on a character within line-of-sight. If a non-attack ability does not specify a range, then line-of-sight is not required. Also note that two hexes separated by a wall line are not considered adjacent, and range cannot be counted through walls."

COMPENDIUM_MonsterAttacks,"A monster will attack on its turn if an <b>Attack</b> ability is part of its drawn card for the round. Any damage dealt is calculated from the attack value present on the ability.<br><br>Monsters will always attack their focused enemies but if the monster can attack multiple targets, it will attack its focused enemy and as many other enemies as possible to maximum effect. If a monster has multiple attacks, it will choose the focus of its other attacks following normal focus rules, excluding targets it is already attacking.<br><br>Monster attacks function exactly like character attacks, and are modified by the attacker’s attack bonuses, then attack modifier cards, then the defense bonuses of their target, and they may be performed with <b>Advantage</b> or <b>Disadvantage</b>."
COMPENDIUM_MonsterAttacks_Title,Monster Attacks
COMPENDIUM_MonsterFocus,"Before performing the action on their ability card, each individual monster will focus on a specific enemy to it – either a character or character summon.<br><br>A monster will focus on the enemy it can perform its current attack against using the least amount of movement. It finds the shortest possible path to get in range and line-of-sight to use its attack, and the enemy that can be attacked at the end of that path is the focus. This enemy is considered the “closest.” It doesn’t matter if the monster can’t get within range to attack with its current movement, as long as there is a path to eventually get within range. <br><br>If a monster does not have an attack listed on its ability card for the round, it finds a focus as if it had a melee attack. In the case where the monster can move the same number of spaces to get within range and line-of-sight of multiple enemies (e.g., because it starts its turn within range of multiple), proximity from the monster’s current position (not counting through walls) is then checked as a tie-breaker for determining “closest.”<br><br>If more than one enemy ties for being the closest, the second priority is to focus on the enemy who is earlier in the initiative order (summons are focused on before the character who summoned them in this regard, even on the round they are summoned).<br><br>In the case where there are no valid targets on which to focus, because there are no valid hexes a monster can attack from (i.e., they are all blocked, occupied, or there is no open path to reach them), regardless of the number of hexes it could move, a monster will not move or attack on its turn, but it will perform any of the other actions on its ability card that it is able."
COMPENDIUM_MonsterFocus_Title,Monster Focus
COMPENDIUM_MonsterMovement_1,"A monster can move on its turn if a <b>Move</b> is present on its ability card. It can move up to a number of hexes equal to the move value. <br><br>If a monster has a move but no attack afterward as part of its ability card, it will use its movement to get as close as possible to its focused target (determined as if it had a melee attack), moving along the shortest possible path to enter a hex adjacent to its focused enemy.<br><br>If a monster has an attack ability after its movement, it will move the least number of hexes possible in such a way as to attack its focused enemy with maximum effect. If it is a single-target melee attack, it will simply move toward the nearest hex adjacent to its focus to attack. If it is a multi-target attack, it will move toward a position where its attack will hit its focused enemy and as many other enemies as possible."
COMPENDIUM_MonsterMovement_2,"If the monster is performing a ranged attack, it will only move toward a hex where it is within range to perform its best possible attack. A monster will also move away from its focused enemy until it can perform the ranged attack without <b>Disadvantage</b>. When forced to choose, a monster will prioritize losing <b>Disadvantage</b> on its focused enemy over maximizing its attack on secondary targets."
COMPENDIUM_MonsterMovement_3,"Even if a monster cannot move into attack range, it will still use its movement to get as close as possible to its focus. Having abilities other than <b>Attack</b> on its ability card does not affect a monster’s movement in any way. It will simply move according to the above rules and then use its other abilities as best as it can."
COMPENDIUM_MonsterMovement_4,"Monsters without the <b>Flying</b> trait consider negative hexes (e.g. ones with traps) to be obstacles when determining focus and movement unless movement through one of these hexes is the only way they can focus on a target. In this case, they will use the path moving through the smallest number of negative hexes possible to find a focus and suffer any consequences."
COMPENDIUM_MonsterMovement_Title,Monster Movement
COMPENDIUM_MonsterTurns,"Monsters’ decisions are controlled by a focus system using action cards to automate what the monsters will do on their turn. All monsters will perform the abilities listed on their drawn card for the round in the order written. They will not move or attack unless these actions are listed on their card.<br><br>Monster cards for the round are drawn per monster type, not per monster. This means that all ""Bandit Archers"" for example would all act out the same abilities for each of their turns. <br><br>All elites of a monster type act first, then the normal monsters of that type act. If more than one elite or normal monster of a given type is present on the board, then the monsters act in ascending numerical order. All monsters of the same type take individual turns, not all together, at the same initiative value listed on their drawn monster card for the round."

COMPENDIUM_MovementTypes_1,"<b>Move X</b> abilities allow a character to move up to X number of hexes on the map. Characters and monsters can move through their allies, but cannot move through their enemies or obstacles. Traps can be moved through and are triggered when their tile is entered with normal movement. Movement cannot end in the same hex as another character or monster. Walls can never be moved through."
COMPENDIUM_MovementTypes_2,"<b>Jump</b><br>Some Move abilities are specified as a <b>Jump</b>. A jump move allows the character to ignore all characters, monsters, obstacles and traps during their movement. However, the last hex of a jump is still considered a normal movement, and so must obey the normal movement rules above – so as much as you may want to land on top of Cragheart, you cannot."
COMPENDIUM_MovementTypes_3,"<b>Flying<br></b><br>Some monsters may also have the <b>Flying</b> special trait. This allows them to completely ignore any characters, monsters, traps and obstacles during any part of their movement, including the last hex, except that they must still end their movement in an unoccupied hex (no characters or monsters present). This includes forced movement like a Push or Pull. If a character loses its Flying trait while occupying an obstacle hex, it takes damage as if it had sprung a damage trap and then moves immediately to the nearest empty hex."

COMPENDIUM_MultipleTargets_1,"Some attacks are accompanied by a <b>Target X</b> value, which means the character can target X different enemies within the attack’s range with the attack."
COMPENDIUM_MultipleTargets_2,"For any attack that targets multiple enemies, an attack modifier card is drawn for each target.

COMPENDIUM_NegativeConditions_6,"<b>STUN:</b>  If a target is stunned, it cannot perform any abilities or use items on its turn (except to perform a long rest in the case of characters). At the end of its next turn, the Stun condition is removed. Players must still play two cards or rest on their turn, and if a player plays two cards while stunned, the actions selected are not used, and the cards are simply discarded."

COMPENDIUM_Obstacles,"Obstacles are various decor elements blocking hexes in a room, impeding normal movement through the hexes they occupy.

Notice that underneath is an option to consume the element Earth (See <b>Elements</b>) to augment this ability to deal two damage instead of one and gain XP. Note that this consume option only applies to the latter instance of damage that directly precedes it on the card.</indent><br><br>• <indent=15>After all three of the abilities are complete, there is 1 XP to be gained from the floating symbol for it within the action, and due to the burned icon in the corner of the card, the card is burned instead of being discarded for choosing this action.</indent>"

EVENT_ADaggerintheChest,"The looted body of an Inox lies slumped against a tree stump up ahead. As you get closer, you notice a dagger protruding from her chest."
EVENT_ADaggerintheChest_A,Remove the dagger
EVENT_ADaggerintheChest_B,Leave her be
EVENT_ADaggerintheChest_DaggerRemoved,The corroded blade breaks off as you try to remove the dagger from her chest. You toss the useless hilt aside and continue down the road.
EVENT_ADaggerintheChest_DaggerRemoved_Gained1,"The corroded blade breaks off as you try to remove the dagger from her chest, and you manage to cut yourself on the broken blade. You are suddenly overcome with a feeling of intense sickness – it would appear that the blade was coated in poison.<br><br>You toss the useless hilt aside and continue down the road, feeling awful."
EVENT_ADaggerintheChest_DaggerRemoved_Gained2,"The corroded blade breaks off as you try to remove the dagger from her chest. As you toss the useless hilt aside, you catch the glint of a small amount of coins clenched tightly in her fist.<br><br>You pry them from her grasp and continue down the road."
EVENT_ADaggerintheChest_Leave,You leave the body of the Inox be and continue down the road.
EVENT_ADiscardedFlask,"You happen upon a stoppered flask lying in the road, clearly dropped by some clumsy adventurer. You pick up the flask and notice that there is still a good amount inside, and you are feeling a tad thirsty..."
EVENT_ADiscardedFlask_A,Take a drink
EVENT_ADiscardedFlask_B,Leave the flask alone
EVENT_ADiscardedFlask_DrinkDrunk,"The flask merely contains a small amount of refreshing water. You drink your fill and continue down the road, your thirst thoroughly quenched."
EVENT_ADiscardedFlask_DrinkDrunk_Gained1,"You have no idea what it is exactly that you are drinking, but it sure is good!<br><br>You share the hearty brew around the party, feeling invigorated as you journey onward."
EVENT_ADiscardedFlask_DrinkDrunk_Gained2,"As you raise the flask to your lips you notice the overpowering stench of strong alcohol, but decide to try nonetheless. Despite your coughing, spluttering and likening of the drink to liquid fire your party members are all too keen to try the strong brew.<br><br>With the flask now empty, you all stumble onwards, somewhat inebriated."
EVENT_ADiscardedFlask_Leave,You resist the urge to drink and toss the flask aside. Perhaps random drinks are best left undrunk!
EVENT_ADownedTraveler,"At a fork in the road you spot a figure up ahead, resting beside a gnarled tree trunk. They appear hunched over, with one hand grasping their chest. As you tentatively get closer they notice you and beckon you over.<br><br>“Hey, over here! Please, help me!”<br><br>There’s a note of desperation in their voice, and a pained groan as the stranger waves to get your attention. However, beneath the tree’s shadow, you can’t quite make out who or what they might be. Could this plea for help be a trap? The surrounding bushes are the perfect place for accomplices to hide, potentially waiting to pounce and rob you."
EVENT_ADownedTraveler_A,Approach the tree with caution
EVENT_ADownedTraveler_B,Find another route
EVENT_ADownedTraveler_Help,"As you draw nearer you see a rocky Savvas in agony, clutching at deep cracks in its glassy chest. It certainly looks like it has seen better days. It looks up to you, hopeful.<br> <br>“I ask only for a small amount of compassion and aid. There is a temple nearby that can treat my wounds, but I haven't enough gold for treatment. If you can you spare some gold, I will reward you with what I can."""
EVENT_ADownedTraveler_Help_A,Take pity on the poor Savvas.
EVENT_ADownedTraveler_Help_A_Subtext,(Lose ¬ADownedTraveler_Pity.GoldAmount¬ Gold)
EVENT_ADownedTraveler_Help_B,"Scoff. There’s no use helping a Savvas with a cracked core, its as good as dead."
EVENT_ADownedTraveler_Leave,"Wary of an ambush, you take a circuitous route through the undergrowth, thorned bushes pulling at your clothes. You lose the path entirely and spend hours being pricked and scratched by all manner of flora before finally stumbling upon the route again, bleeding and thoroughly miserable."
EVENT_ADownedTraveler_Pity,"You hand the Savvas the gold, who grimaces as it rises to its feet, thanking you for your charity. It holds up a small pulsating crystal, bathing you in a green light.<br><br>You feel a rush of energy as you bask in its glow. The Savvas bids you farewell and you wish it a speedy recovery, before you head in opposite directions down the path."
EVENT_ADownedTraveler_Scoff,"You leave the Savvas to its fate and continue on. As you walk away, you hear it muttering something under its breath. A painfully icy chill runs down your spine, and you can't help but wonder whether the Savvas cursed you with ice magic..."
EVENT_AFatefulEncounter,"With the darkness of night drawing ever closer, you scan your surroundings for shelter from that which lurks within the shadows. You notice a light emanating from a nearby cave. and decide to investigate. <br><br>Cautiously moving towards the light, you find that inside a cave sits a lone Orchid in meditation, who seems oblivious to your presence. The glow from the large crystals on her skin illuminate the entirety of the cave.<br><br>You see paintings on the cave walls that appear to depict previous quests you have undertaken, even the very journey that took you to this cave. Next to the Orchid lies some chalk, rations and a bag of coins."
EVENT_AFatefulEncounter_A,Wait for the Orchid to finish meditating
EVENT_AFatefulEncounter_B,Take the coins and leave
EVENT_AFatefulEncounter_Take_Gold,"The light shining from the Orchid's crystals is almost blinding as you edge your way closer and closer to the bag of coins. Somehow you manage to swipe the bags without disturbing the Orchid and hightail it out of the cave.<br><br>As you open up the bag you find a small scrap of parchment alongside the coins, with another drawing, this time of you holding the bag in your hands and reading that very note. You wonder if the Orchid could have rewarded you with more than gold had you not stolen from her..."
EVENT_AFatefulEncounter_Take_Muddle,"The light shining from the Orchid's crystals is almost blinding as you edge your way closer and closer to the bag of coins. As you carefully lift up the bag as quietly as you can, you notice a faint drawing on the floor of you taking it and the bolt of lightning hitting you… <br><br>You wake up on the floor of the cave the next morning, somewhat singed. Thankfully you are still in one piece, and even still have the coins – along with the worst splitting headache you've ever had."
EVENT_AFatefulEncounter_Wait,"You wait for the Orchid to finish her meditation. Finally, at the break of dawn, you gaze tired and exhausted at the Orchid as the glow from her crystals begins to fade. She slowly opens her amethyst eyes.<br><br>“Greetings travelers, I have been expecting you.” The Orchid announces, smiling coyly as she gathers her belongings. ""You undoubtedly have many questions, but I unfortunately have little time. Before I depart, allow me to read the signs to see what is in store for you...""<br><br>Without looking away from you, she gestures to one of the cave paintings – one that you are certain was not there before – depicting this very conversation you are having with the Orchid."
EVENT_AFatefulEncounter_Wait_A,Continue
EVENT_AFatefulEncounter_Wait_Curse,"The Orchid closes her eyes again and gestures with her other hand to an empty spot on the wall. She whispers something that you can't quite comprehend before the image of a small spider forms.<br><br>""The spider is cursed with a lonely existence, working long and hard on her web in solitude. Those that would dare disturb her feel her venom.""<br><br>Before you can ask her what she means, she snaps her fingers and disappears, and with her all of the cave paintings – only rough-hewn rock remains. You prepare yourselves for the day's journey, pondering what it was exactly that she meant."
EVENT_AFatefulEncounter_Wait_Gold,"The Orchid closes her eyes again and gestures with her other hand to an empty spot on the wall. She whispers something that you can't quite comprehend before the image of a bag of coins forms.<br><br>""Wealth brings joy to many, but the distraction of gold leads to a lack of focus – fortune into misfortune.""<br><br>Before you can ask her what she means, she snaps her fingers and disappears, and with her all of the cave paintings – only rough-hewn rock remains. The only thing left of her posessions is the bag of coins she was sat next to. You take it and prepare yourselves for the day's journey, pondering what it was exactly that she meant."
EVENT_AFatefulEncounter_Wait_XP,"The Orchid closes her eyes again and gestures with her other hand to an empty spot on the wall. She whispers something that you can't quite comprehend before the image of a penitent man forms, with his hands clasped together.<br><br>""There is much to be learned from our errors, but do not be consumed by your contrition.""<br><br>Before you can ask her what she means, she snaps her fingers and disappears, and with her all of the cave paintings – only rough-hewn rock remains. Perhaps she has great insight, or perhaps it was just nonsense, but you feel as though you have learned something about yourself in this cave – although having stayed up all night will take its toll physically."
EVENT_AShortcut,"Tired of traversing a tedious route around a dense forest, you contemplate taking a path straight through the maze of branches to shorten your journey time considerably. You notice a slight clearing behind the bushes up ahead that could prove to be a shortcut through the dense forest."
EVENT_AShortcut_A,Try the potential shortcut
EVENT_AShortcut_B,Continue down the road
EVENT_AShortcut_Berries,"The berries are somehow unremarkable in just about every aspect. You rejoin the road without bothering to take any of the bland berries with you, pleased that the shortcut was a success."
EVENT_AShortcut_Berries_Gained1,"The berries not only taste foul, but seem to be poisonous too! Why exactly each and every member of your party decided to try the berries you're not quite sure, but you all feel dreadful as you now rejoin the road, clutching at your stomachs."
EVENT_AShortcut_Berries_Gained2,"The berries not only taste great, but seem to have invigorating properties of some kind – you feel better than you have in months! You fill your pockets to the brim with the delicious berries and rejoin the road."
EVENT_AShortcut_ContinueDownRoad,"After mulling it over, you decide it's perhaps best to continue down the road."
EVENT_AShortcut_TakeTheShortcut,"The clearing continues on through the forest and you are pleased to make it through to the other side. At the forest's edge, you are just about to rejoin the road when you notice a small patch of bushes nearby, adorned with strange purple berries."
EVENT_AShortcut_TakeTheShortcut_A,Try the berries
EVENT_AShortcut_TakeTheShortcut_B,Continue down the road
EVENT_AbandonedCart,"A cart lies seemingly abandoned by the side of the road; whoever owns it is nowhere to be seen. The back of the cart is mostly loaded with junk, but there is a barrel loaded with food – and you are feeling rather hungry..."
EVENT_AbandonedCart_A,Eat the food
EVENT_AbandonedCart_B,Leave the cart alone
EVENT_AbandonedCart_Eat,"The food is rather stale, and after a few attempted bites at a rock-solid loaf of bread, you toss it aside with a sigh.<br><br>You continue down the road, disappointed that you hadn't come across the cart earlier when the food was still edible."
EVENT_AbandonedCart_Eat_Poison,"The food smells slightly odd, but you greedily eat your fill from the barrel nonetheless.<br><br>As you turn to leave, your stomach suddenly starts to gurgle and growl loudly. A few moments later, and you find yourself keeled over in the bushes, vomiting profusely.<br><br>Perhaps you'll think twice next time before consuming mysteriously abandoned food."
EVENT_AbandonedCart_Eat_Strengthen,"The food in the barrel is far superior to the supplies you brought with you - soft loaves of seeded bread, strips of dry-cured meat, fresh fruits and vegetables – a true feast! You fashion a hearty meal from the barrel's contents and eat your fill.<br><br>Feeling invigorated, you continue down the road."
EVENT_AbandonedCart_Leave,"Tempting as the food poking out of the barrel may be, you decide to leave the cart alone lest the owner return, and continue down the path."
EVENT_AbandonedCart_Leave2,"As you begin to walk away, there is a sudden rustling of leaves from the bushes by the side of the road. A short, portly man emerges from the bushes, hoisting his breeches when he spots you and jumps slightly in surprise.<br><br>'Oh! Well met, fellow travellers,' he says, nodding his head in greeting. He looks over at his cart and smiles. 'Thank you for not stealing from my cart while I was... preoccupied. Y'know, I have more food than I could possibly eat back there – you're welcome to join me for a meal.'<br><br>You accept the man's offer and partake in a meal far superior to the meagre supplies you brought with you. You finish your meal and part ways with the kind man, invigorated by the fine meal you consumed."
EVENT_AbandonedCart_Leave_A,Leave
EVENT_AbandonedCart_Leave_Gained,"Tempting as the food poking out of the barrel may be, you decide to leave the cart alone lest the owner return, and continue down the path."
EVENT_AmbushAftermath,"There was a massacre here – the bodies of a group of clerics and healers lie strewn across the path. Whoever killed these people appears to be long gone.<br><br>They could still have valuables should you choose to loot them, but you also wonder whether the powers that be might smile upon those that would bury them."
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_A,Loot the bodies
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_B,Bury the bodies
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_Bury2,"Somehow you get the feeling that despite your good intentions with burying the dead, the fact you looted them first negates this good deed somewhat."
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_Bury_Bless,"You feel that you have done the right thing in burying these poor souls. Content with your good deed, you journey onward."
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_Bury_Disarm,"Just as you are about to start digging, you hear the snap of a twig underfoot. You look up to find yourself suddenly surrounded by a small group of not-so-long-gone bandits – it's an ambush! There's nowhere to run. You've no choice but to fight them."
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_C,Leave
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_Fight,"Despite being outnumbered and caught off guard by the bandits, it eventually becomes clear to them that you are far tougher than the previous group they ambushed. As they begin to turn tail and run, you notice one of the bandits running off with what little loot there was left from their previous ambush.<br><br>You decide not to stay and find out if the bandits intend to return with reinforcements!"
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_Leave,"Whoever killed these people could return at any moment, and you don't quite fancy meeting the same fate – you hurriedly leave the area."
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_Loot,"The corpses have been picked clean already, there is nothing of value left at all."
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_Loot_A,Bury the bodies
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_Loot_B,Leave
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_Loot_Disarm,"As you begin to sift through corpses and their belongings, you hear the snap of a twig underfoot. You look up to find yourself suddenly surrounded by a small group of not-so-long-gone bandits – it's an ambush! There's nowhere to run. You've no choice but to fight them."
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_Loot_Disarm_A,Fight the bandits
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_Loot_Gold,"None of the gear is in good enough condition to be of use, with anything of worth likely having been looted already by whoever killed these people. You do manage to find a small quantity of gold tucked away in the pocket of one of the deceased however!"
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_Loot_Item,"Much of the gear is in too poor a condition to be of use, with anything of worth likely having been looted already. However, you do manage to find one item which could be of use to you, that whoever killed these people must have missed!"
EVENT_BloodyValrath,"While passing through a graveyard, you notice fresh footprints in the dirt, meandering from grave to grave. A feeling of dread grows inside you as you track the passage of the footprints, when suddenly a man’s piercing scream cuts through the eerie silence. <br><br>You tentatively sneak over to the origin of the scream to find a female Valrath, and in front of her a dead man beside an open grave. He is wearing a torn dark cloak, often worn by cultists, and you can see from his wounds that he had a bloody and violent death.<br><br>The Valrath woman is wearing a magnificent necklace and dress typical of Valrath high society, bulky and colorful.  Something seems amiss however, as you notice the dress is moth-eaten, she has dirt in her hair and her trembling hand is clutching a knife with fresh blood dripping from it."
EVENT_BloodyValrath_A,Offer assistance
EVENT_BloodyValrath_A_Subtext,The Valrath could well be the victim here...
EVENT_BloodyValrath_Attack,"Despite your attempts at a sneak attack, the Valrath is prepared. She dodges swiftly before leaping towards you, striking powerfully with her knife. You ferociously exchange blows for a while before catching her neck with a well timed strike, sending her severed head flying towards a gravestone.<br><br>As soon as her body collapses to the ground it disintegrates into a pile of ash, and the feeling of dread is immediately lifted. Wounded but relieved, you head back to the path, wondering what had transpired between her and the cultist – not to mention who or perhaps <i>what</i> she was..."
EVENT_BloodyValrath_B,Attack her by surprise
EVENT_BloodyValrath_B_Subtext,She seems potentially dangerous...
EVENT_BloodyValrath_C,Order her to hand it over
EVENT_BloodyValrath_C_Subtext,The necklace looks valuable...
EVENT_BloodyValrath_D,Run before she notices you
EVENT_BloodyValrath_D_Subtext,Nothing here seems quite right...
EVENT_BloodyValrath_Help,"You make your presence known and tell her that you mean no harm. She is still trembling, seeming to be in shock. Unable to get any information from her other than that she wants to go home, you give her a few coins, some food for the journey and point her in the direction of the nearest village.<br><br>She shyly nods at you as if to say thanks, whispers a few strange words, and slowly turns to leave, the sense of dread lifting from you as she goes."
EVENT_BloodyValrath_Leave,"Whatever is going on here, you want no part of it. You head back towards the forest but you hear the Valrath calling out to you, imploring that you help her. <br><br>Determined to get away, you press on without looking back. The Valrath shrieks something unintellible at you, and the strange feeling of dread grows stronger. As you leave the graveyard, certain that you have been cursed, you wonder what would have happened had you stayed to ""help"" her..."
EVENT_BloodyValrath_Rob,"She turns as if to fight, but upon seeing she is outnumbered, she begrudgingly accepts. She hands over the necklace, cursing and spitting at you with words you have never heard from the mouth of a Valrath before. As she storms away angrily, you examine the corpse of the cultist and wonder what exactly transpired here.<br><br>You notice the inscriptions on the necklace match the epitaph on the gravestone above the empty grave... perhaps her name? With all sorts of eerie possibilities running through your head, you suddenly feel very unwell, and shivers run down your spine. You hastily leave the graveyard, hoping that the sickness will pass once you leave this cursed place and sell the necklace at the next opportunity."
EVENT_BrokenCart,"You come across an elderly wine merchant by the side of the road. One of the wheels of his cart has fallen off and you see him struggling to put it back on. He doesn't seem to notice you as you approach, but it is clear he hasn't the strength to lift the cart to replace the wheel by himself."
EVENT_BrokenCart_A,Offer to help the wine merchant
EVENT_BrokenCart_B,Rob the wine merchant
EVENT_BrokenCart_C,Leave
EVENT_BrokenCart_Drink,"The wine is some of the finest you have ever tasted. Feeling invigorated by the fine vintage, you continue down the road."
EVENT_BrokenCart_Drink2,"The wine tastes foul – you spit it out almost immediately. With nothing else of value to take from the merchant, you leave him to deal with the broken wheel by himself and continue down the road."
EVENT_BrokenCart_Drink2_Gained_Muddle,"The wine tastes good, but perhaps a little too good – you all drink far more than you probably should. You stumble away, well and truly intoxicated."
EVENT_BrokenCart_Drink2_Gained_Strengthen,The wine tastes incredible – you all feel invigorated for having consumed such a fine vintage. You leave the merchant to deal with the broken wheel by himself and continue down the road.
EVENT_BrokenCart_Help,"You tap the wine merchant on the shoulder, startling him enough to make him jump into the air.<br><br>'GAH! Don't sneak up on an old man like that!'<br><br>His beady eyes glance around the party through a pair of dirty, scratched spectacles. Just as you are about to open your mouth to offer assistance, he snaps at you.<br><br>'Are you just going to stand there all day? You there, stop gawping and lift the cart up, and you, hold the wheel steady! On the count of three – that is, ON three, NOT after – you're going to lift the wheel and...'<br><br>You may be here all day."
EVENT_BrokenCart_Help2,"You manage to get the wheel back onto the cart without too much difficulty, although as far as the merchant is concerned he 'could've done it much more easily without the help of you buffoons!' The merchant continues to rant about your ineptitude as he departs without even an uttering a word of thanks.<br><br>As you are about to leave, you notice a bottle of wine has fallen off of the cart into the shrubs by the side of the road. With the merchant already some distance down the road, you decide to take it as repayment for your assistance and share it amongst the party."
EVENT_BrokenCart_Help2_Gained,"You manage to get the wheel back onto the cart without too much difficulty, although as far as the merchant is concerned he 'could've done it much more easily without the help of you buffoons!' The merchant continues to rant about your ineptitude as he tosses you a handful of coins for your assistance and departs without even an uttering a word of thanks."
EVENT_BrokenCart_Help2_Gained_Next,Next
EVENT_BrokenCart_Help_A,Help the wine merchant
EVENT_BrokenCart_Leave,You decide the merchant's problems are none of your concern and pass him by.
EVENT_BrokenCart_Rob,"The merchant cowers behind his cart as he sees you approach with weapons drawn.<br><br>""P-Please don't hurt me!"" he stammered. ""I'll give you what little gold I have, a-and you can take as much wine as you like, just please leave me be!""<br><br>With trembling hands he reaches down to his belt, removes a small pouch of coins, and tosses it towards you. ""It's all the gold I've got, I swear!""<br><br>You pick it up and pocket the gold before picking up a bottle of wine from the cart."
EVENT_BrokenCart_Rob_A,Drink
EVENT_BucketofLuck,"Up ahead you notice a peculiar-looking man has set up a stall at a fork in the road. As you get closer, you see a large wooden barrel filled to the brim with what appears to be soil.

EVENT_BucketofLuck_A,Approach the stall
EVENT_BucketofLuck_Approach,"As you approach, you see that the man is covered in a layer of dirt, with it caked under his long, claw-like fingernails. He notices you staring and chuckles. 'Well, I gotta get me prizes from somewhere, don't I?' he says with a wry smile, before awkwardly winking at you.<br><br>""¬LoseSmallGold.GoldAmount¬ of your finest gold pieces to play – who knows what ye might find, eh?"""

EVENT_BucketofLuck_GainedLoot_Gained1,"You feel around inside the barrel for a while, before brushing your hand up against something. You grab it tightly and pull out a pair of leather boots.<br><br>""Cor, they've got quite a pong to 'em, don't they?"" He pinches his nose, seemingly oblivious to the fact that he smells far worse than the boots. ""Used to belong to a City Guard, if I remember rightly.""<br><br>Looking at the boots, they appear to be well-made from high quality leather, albeit a tad worn. After brushing the dirt off of your arm and the boots, you take your leave."
EVENT_BucketofLuck_GainedLoot_Gained2,"You feel around inside the barrel for a while, before brushing your hand up against something. You grab it tightly and pull out a pair of worn goggles.<br><br>""Ah, those things... I could barely see through 'em, truth be told, but I'm sure ye can find more use for 'em than I did.""<br><br>Wiping off the dirt and bidding the strange man farewell, you try on the goggles as you continue down the road."
EVENT_BucketofLuck_Leave,You decide you'd rather not stick your hand into a barrel of who-knows-what. You politely refuse the strange man's offer and take your leave.
EVENT_BucketofLuck_PlayBarrel,"You hand over the gold and he pockets it greedily. ""Go on then, stick yer 'and in!""<br><br>You dig your arm deep into the barrel, not exactly sure what to expect."

EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_10_INTRO,"Relaxing for the evening at the Sleeping Lion, a shifty-looking man approaches you, hand outstretched. In it are a pair of pale dice with crude marks scratched on them.<br><br>“Greetings, friends. You look like you could stand to liven things up a bit. Care for a quick game of bone dice with me? I’m sure we could make it interesting.” His other hand pats a coin purse at his side."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_10_OPTION_A,Play a game with the man. It may prove to be a good time. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_10_OPTION_B,Refuse the game of dice. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_10_RESULT_A_A,"You get into the game, but after a few rounds, your enthusiasm wanes as the man displays a streak of luck that can only be described as “uncanny.” You leave the table empty-handed."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_10_RESULT_A_B,"The man clearly intends to cheat you out of your hard-earned money. He’s not the only one capable of cheating, however. After a few rounds, you wipe that smile right off his face."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_10_RESULT_B,"You laugh and wave away the man’s offer. You get all the excitement you need fighting toe-to-toe against vicious monsters. In combat, what matters most is planning and tactics, which are far more interesting than some random roll of the dice."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_11_INTRO,"“Please, something of interest, sirs.” The words come through in chitters and hisses. You turn your head toward an alley in the Ward of Scales to see a Harrower dressed in crude robes and a mask. It holds out a piece of parchment.<br><br>“Something for sirs. Very powerful. Just five gold.”<br><br>You can see the parchment has the designs for something on it, but still—you recognize this Harrower. It is known for trading in disreputable goods. You can’t know where that parchment came from, and if anyone saw you dealing with this creature...well, they might get the wrong idea."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_11_OPTION_A,Make a deal with the Harrower. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_11_OPTION_B,Shake your head and walk away. Best not to take chances in such situations. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_11_RESULT_A_A,"Intrigued by the parchment, you quickly make a decision to buy it off the Harrower. The exchange is fast, and then you move on your way, hoping no one saw you."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_11_RESULT_A_B,"You try to pay the Harrower less than it asks for, which only manages to anger it. It hisses loudly and shuns you."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_11_RESULT_B,You loudly refuse the Harrower’s offer and continue about your business. That thing should know better than to stray from the Sinking Market.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_12_INTRO,"A great revelry is underway at the New Market when you arrive to purchase supplies. Investigating further, you discover the town is in the midst of a pie-eating contest.<br><br>A group of large sailors sits triumphantly at a long table on a makeshift stage, crumbs and bits of fruit scattered all around. A man in the center stands and addresses the crowd.<br><br>“Can no one best our pie-eating prowess? Step up and test your mettle!” With nothing better to do, you head up to the stage.<br><br>The contest goes well for a while as you match the others pie-for-pie, but soon your eating starts to slow, and the sailors are still going strong."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_12_OPTION_A,Yield to the pie and admit defeat.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_12_OPTION_B,Power through the pain. You will not be bested. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_12_RESULT_A,"You put down your utensils and yield to the sailors. They roar with pride and slap you on the back. Unfortunately, the sudden jolt doesn’t sit well with your stomach, and soon all the pies you ate are coming back up, much to the disgust of the gathered crowd."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_12_RESULT_B,"You emit a primal yell and continue eating. Pie after pie, your willpower cannot be broken, and eventually the sailors are forced to concede. However, you cannot even stand to shake your foes’ hands. Your legs are boneless, and your stomach feels worse than it has ever felt before. You have earned glory and prize money, but all you want to do is lie down and wait for the horror to pass."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_13_INTRO,"You are walking across the Silent Bridge, headed toward the Sleeping Lion to get a quick meal, when you see a Quatryl standing in front of a small cart laden with plates of food and curious contraptions.<br><br>“Come try the delicacies of the East!” the Quatryl barks. “Food enhanced with science! Flavors beyond your wildest imagination!”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_13_OPTION_A,Stop and try the food. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_13_OPTION_B,Continue on your way to a less adventurous meal.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_13_RESULT_A,"You decide to indulge in the unknown and see what the Quatryl is offering. He looks very pleased at your approach and instructs you to inhale a tube of vapors, then take a bite from a bowl full of tiny golden spheres. As the spheres melt in your mouth, the taste mixes with the aroma of the vapors to create a wonderful experience. You pay what you can, but the Quatryl seems solely focused on how much you enjoyed the meal."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_13_RESULT_B,"After a quick glance at the cart, you are not even sure how you would go about eating most of the food. Best to play it safe in these situations and stick to what you know will fill you up cheaply."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_14_INTRO,"You hear screams from the south as you approach the docks and see a group of women running toward you in a panic.<br><br>“An invasion!” They yell as they race by you, nearly knocking you over.<br><br>You hurry to the docks and find a crowd of workers on edge, armed with makeshift weapons and circling one particular pier.<br><br>Standing at the far end of the wooden planks is a group of Lurkers—terrifying crab-like monsters as big as an Inox and equally ferocious. Except these Lurkers don’t appear to be hostile. They are simply standing on the dock, clacking their claws in a strange rhythm."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_14_OPTION_A,Raise arms and fight the Lurkers back into the sea. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_14_OPTION_B,Approach the Lurkers cautiously and attempt to communicate with them. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_14_RESULT_A,"The crowd parts as you approach the dock with weapons drawn. You step onto the soft wood and the Lurkers turn toward you and stop clacking. They all hiss and brandish their claws in aggression. You charge forward and meet the threat head-on, hacking away at their carapaces until they scuttle off the dock and back into the water."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_14_RESULT_B,"The crowd parts as you move toward the dock with both confidence and care. The Lurkers notice your approach and continue to clack in your direction. You call out to them and ask why they are here, but all you get in response is a change in the tempo of their clacking. When you express confusion, they clack again in frustration and scuttle back into the ocean. The crowd is very impressed that you managed to ward off the creatures without using force."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_15_INTRO,"It was a truly marvelous night, full of alcohol and fuzzy memories. You are heading back to your rooms in high spirits when you take a wrong turn into an alley and trip over a mutilated corpse.<br><br>“What’s all this, then?” You look up to see a city guard walk into the alley, annoyed by all the noise you were making in your revelry.<br><br>Before you can react, he draws his sword. “You...what did you do?”<br><br>You look and see that, due to the fall, your clothes are now covered in blood. The guard clearly thinks you are responsible for the man’s death. This night just took a serious turn for the worse."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_15_OPTION_A,Do your best to explain that the man was like this when you found him.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_15_OPTION_B,"Panic and kill the guard, then dispose of both corpses."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_15_RESULT_A_A,"You sober up pretty quickly and explain the situation. Luckily, the guard is familiar with your reputation and believes your story. After a few more questions, he allows you to leave and clean up."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_15_RESULT_A_B,"Attempts to explain yourself just seem to make the situation worse. More guards show up and everyone eyes you suspiciously. Luckily your weapons don’t match the man’s wounds, and the guards let you go, but they do so with a mistrustful glare."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_15_RESULT_B,"The unlucky guard falls to your blade before he is able to call for help. If the bodies are found, it could cause a lot of trouble for you."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_15_RESULT_B_A,"You go looking for someone who can properly dispose of the mess. It’s not cheap, but one of your contacts promises to make the bodies disappear."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_15_RESULT_B_B,"Knowing you don’t have enough to professional help, you spend all night cleaning up the mess before anyone discovers it."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_16_INTRO,"“Stop struggling! You’re coming with me and there’s nothing you can do about it!”<br><br>Ahead of you in the street, you see a pair of guards scuffling with a young boy dressed in rags. “You snatch purses, you go to the Ghost Fortress. No way around that.”<br><br>“But my family is starving,” the boy cries. You recognize his voice from some of your dealings in the Sunken Market. He’s given you helpful tips for mercenary work on a number of occasions."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_16_OPTION_A,Intervene on the boy's behalf. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_16_OPTION_B,Let the guards haul the boy away to prison. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_16_RESULT_A_A,"You entreat the guards to let the boy go, but they are unmoved. With further pressing, they agree to do so only if you pay his criminal fine. The guards cuff the boy’s ear and set him free."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_16_RESULT_A_B,"You entreat the guards to let the boy go, but they are unmoved. It seems like you may be able to grease their palms a bit, but, unfortunately, you do not have enough money to sway their minds. The boy is hauled off to the Ghost Fortress."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_16_RESULT_B,"There are repercussions to getting caught, and like the guard said, sometimes there’s no way out of it. You owe the boy nothing, and so let the guards take him away."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_17_INTRO,"Returning to Gloomhaven with your latest haul of treasure, you approach the market in search of a good trade. Unfortunately, there are only a few visible stands around that are not yet packing up for the day.<br><br>A robed Savvas catches your eye. It has a few strange artifacts on display, but you approach with no great expectation, hoping your goods will fetch a decent price.<br><br>The Savvas silently nods as you approach. It picks through your haul and lifts up a single item, holding out a small bag for you in exchange.<br><br>Pouring out the bag’s contents, a single rectangular black-and-white coin lands in your palm."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_17_OPTION_A,Demand a different payment. The single coin is an insult. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_17_OPTION_B,Accept the strange coin and research it for hidden value. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_17_RESULT_A,"You slam the strange coin back down onto the Savvas’ display in anger. It reaches out to grab the coin, but you take hold of its arm and demand a proper payment. Wordlessly, it looks at you with disdain and throws a handful of gold in your face. You shield your eyes and move to draw your weapon, but when you look around, the Savvas and its goods are no longer to be found. You sullenly gather the coins it threw and move on."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_17_RESULT_B,"You calmly assess that the coin may possess much more value than it appears to have. You head to the University and spend hours looking through old records to no avail. You end the day in a tavern, easing the frustration with a drink and loud laments about the coin. “Those markings are very interesting.” You look up to see an Aesther standing over you. “They describe a special meeting place. I can show you where.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_18_INTRO,"You are attending to business in the Sinking Market when a frail white-haired woman approaches you and grabs you by the arm.<br><br>“Oh my, don’t you lot look strong,” she says. “Could you possibly assist me with a small problem I am having in my cellar?”<br><br>Her eyes grow narrow. “Rats! So many rats! I don’t know where they’re coming from, but they are a right nuisance. Ruined three jars of preserves just yesterday!”<br><br>She tugs weakly at your sleeve. “Please, can you help me?”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_18_OPTION_A,Decline to help the old woman.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_18_OPTION_B,Agree to help with the rat infestation. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_18_RESULT_A,"You pull your arm away from her filthy grasp and step away, making apologies for being too busy. Your excuses lack the proper tact, however, and soon the woman is bawling in the street, lamenting that no one will help her and how the rats will kill her in her sleep, then feast on her corpse. The whole speech is very graphic, and passersby begin to give you odd looks, wondering what you could have done to upset the poor woman so intensely."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_18_RESULT_B,"You smile broadly and ask the woman to lead you to her house. It is a ramshackle dwelling half sunk into the muddy foundation. And inside there are certainly a lot of rats. You kill as many as you can, but in her cellar you find a large hole leading to a section of sewer that recently collapsed, leaving the pests with nowhere else to go. The woman thanks you for at least helping her to be able to sleep tonight and hands you a few coins."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_19_INTRO,"A curious invitation is slipped under your door in the early morning. It is for a wedding ceremony between the children of two wealthy Gloomhaven merchants. Your exploits seem to have placed you in their good graces, and so they would like you to join them on this special occasion, provided you don’t show up in blood-soaked armor.<br><br>And for the love of the Great Oak, bring a gift."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_19_OPTION_A,Attend the wedding with an expensive gift. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_19_OPTION_B,Attend the wedding and bring a mundane gift. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_19_RESULT_A_A,"You head to the New Market and find a magnificent vase to bring as a gift. When the father of the bride sees it, he declares it the most wonderful piece he’s ever encountered. You are the talk of the town."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_19_RESULT_A_B,"You bring a very expensive vase as a gift, but you can’t seem to catch the father of the bride’s eye to present it at the right time."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_19_RESULT_B_A,"You pick up an unremarkable set of silverware on the way to the event. When you arrive, the father of the bride casts a scornful look your way and begins whispering to those around him. Maybe you received the invitation by mistake."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_19_RESULT_B_B,"You are one guest among many, and everyone is having too good of a time to notice your poor choice in gifts."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_1_INTRO,"You decide to unwind at the Sleeping Lion, but just as you are starting to relax, a bear of a man crashes into your table, scattering your drinks across the floor.<br><br>Towering over him is a massive Inox. “What did you say about my horns?” the Inox shouts. The man stands up and brushes shards of glass from his tunic. “I said the sight of them makes me want to vomit!”<br><br>The Inox roars and charges headlong into the man, crashing through more tables in the process. At this, the entire tavern erupts into violence. After all, when a man is deep into his drink, the last thing you want to do is knock that drink over."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_1_OPTION_A,Join the fray! These insults will not go unanswered!
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_1_OPTION_A_A,Pay the man for the damage done
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_1_OPTION_A_B,Refuse to pay
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_1_OPTION_B,Do your best to stop the fighting. This is a respectable establishment. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_1_RESULT_A,"Nothing like busting some drunken skulls to lift one’s spirits. It turns out to be a great way to unwind. Unfortunately, the proprietor of the Sleeping Lion doesn’t exactly see it that way, and he sullenly asks for compensation for the damage you caused."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_1_RESULT_B,"After restraining the enraged Inox and offering to replace the drinks of a few of the more belligerent patrons, you calm the place down a bit. Some of the non-human patrons are understandably on edge, but the proprietor thanks you for your efforts and reimburses you for the drinks."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_1_RESULT_C,The Sleeping Lion is essentially your home when in Gloomhaven so you consider it a wise investment to pay for the damage and stay on the proprietor's good side.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_1_RESULT_D,"Maybe the other patrons didn't knock down that wall or set the stairs on fire, and perhaps that means you won't be quite as welcome here next time, but you didn't start the fight, so you aren't going to pay for it!"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_20_INTRO,"You are relaxing at the Sleeping Lion when an immaculately dressed man approaches your table, a fake smile plastered to his face.<br><br>“Ah, you must be the mercenaries everyone is talking about, yes? My name is Lord Greymane and I have a delicate matter to discuss. May I sit?”<br><br>You gesture to a chair and he sits with a faint grimace. “I am transporting some valuable goods this evening from one of my warehouses, and I have reason to believe that some of the less desirable elements of this city wish to steal from me. I would like to hire you to help guard the undertaking.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_20_OPTION_A,Agree to guard the goods. It should be easy money.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_20_OPTION_B,Politely decline. You have much better things to do tonight. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_20_RESULT_A_A,"You head to the warehouse and watch in silence as a number of heavy crates are loaded onto a cart. You then escort the cart to the West Gate. No thefts are attempted, and you are paid well."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_20_RESULT_A_B,"You head to the warehouse and are immediately set upon by a group of thieves. However, they prove no match for your expertise and are quickly dispatched. Greymane thanks you."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_20_RESULT_B,"This is your night off, and you are going to spend it drinking, not guarding some snobby “lord.”<br><br>In the morning, you hear news that a shipment of rare minerals bound for the capital was stolen in the night. People are calling it a huge blow to the economy of the town."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_21_INTRO,"“I’ve been told you are the group to talk to if you want to get something done around here.”<br><br>You look up from your table at the Sleeping Lion to see a rustic man in leather armor standing in front of you.<br><br>This tavern may as well be your office, due to the number of people coming through the doors looking for your help. You nod at the man, and he makes his request.<br><br>“My brother went out hunting in the Corpsewood two days ago and hasn’t returned since. I fear the worst. If you are traveling in that direction, I hope you wouldn’t mind keeping an eye out for him.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_21_OPTION_A,Demand payment up front before agreeing to look for the man's brother. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_21_OPTION_B,Agree to help the man in his search. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_21_RESULT_A_A,"“What? I... Oh, very well,” the man stutters. “Since I trust you to keep your word, I’ll give you a little money for your trouble.” The man describes his brother and hands you a small coin pouch."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_21_RESULT_A_B,"The man puffs up in indignation, letting you know he is insulted by your behavior. He storms out of the tavern in a rage."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_21_RESULT_B,"The man thanks you profusely and gives a detailed description of his brother. “If you find him, no matter the condition, please let me know right away.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_22_INTRO,"You decide to head to the Brown Door for the evening to enjoy a Quatryl concert.<br><br>Corruption and crime run rampant in the bar, but the music is unmatched in all of Gloomhaven.<br><br>You are enjoying yourself immensely when you catch a glimpse of a man in a dark, tattered robe near the back of the room. He appears to be handing vials full of red liquid to a second man."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_22_OPTION_A,Further investigate the exchange between the men.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_22_OPTION_B,Leave the criminal element alone and continue enjoying the show. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_22_RESULT_A,"You subtly move in the direction of the men, monitoring their actions with your peripheral vision. You recognize the dark robes from the run-ins you have had with cultists in the area, and as you get closer, you become convinced that the vials being traded contain blood. You grab the men and cause a huge amount of commotion as you fight to drag them outside and foil their dealings. You are able to hand them off to the proper authorities, but it may be a while before you are allowed back in the Brown Door. The concert was ruined."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_22_RESULT_B,The music is too good to be interrupted. You ignore the men in the back and simply have a great time.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_23_INTRO,"You are walking home late at night when you hear some suspicious sounds coming from a nearby garden.<br><br>You move to investigate, and a shadowy figure bolts in the opposite direction carrying an armful of vegetables."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_23_OPTION_A,Give chase. Thieves must be brought to justice.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_23_OPTION_B,The thief had the right idea. Grab some vegetables for yourself.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_23_RESULT_A,"The figure overburdened with vegetables is no match for your speed. You quickly run him down and deliver him to the city guard. Thankfully very little of the produce was damaged in the pursuit, and you are able to return it to the owner of the garden."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_23_RESULT_B,"In an area cut off from civilization with no viable farmland, fresh vegetables are a rare commodity. The thief already made off with an armful, so what’s the harm in taking some more? When you get back to your room, you cook up a nice hearty soup and have a great meal."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_24_INTRO,"Upon returning to the city after your latest adventure, you are approached by a high-ranking guard at the gate.<br><br>“Ah, good, I’m glad to have caught you,” the guard begins. “The capital has fallen behind on shipments of wood to Gloomhaven, so now it falls to us to pick up the slack so that construction of important city buildings doesn’t stagnate.”<br><br>The guard points to the east. “We’re forming an expedition to gather logs from the Corpsewood. We could use your help, either to guard against enemies or to chop down trees.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_24_OPTION_A,Join the expedition as a guard. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_24_OPTION_B,Join the expedition as a logger. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_24_RESULT_A,"The logging expedition heads to the outskirts of the Corpsewood and begins felling trees and transporting them back to Gloomhaven. You stay on your guard, patrolling the area and making sure there are no surprise attacks. A couple hours in, a tribe of Vermlings appear through the woods, but you are alert and prepared, dispatching them without a single casualty. The rest of the day goes by uneventfully."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_24_RESULT_B,"You journey out to the Corpsewood, axe in hand, and begin chopping away at the trees. You seem to have a natural skill with it, probably due to all the practice you get swinging a blade. Thanks to your help, the city is able to gather a large amount of extra wood for construction. You encounter some dangers throughout the day, but nothing you cannot handle."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_25_INTRO,"On a trip to the Coin District, you catch sight of an old, wiry Valrath carrying a large, intricate vase out his front door. As you get closer, the Valrath begins to struggle with the vase, sweat pouring from his brow. Under the strain, the Valrath loses his balance, and the fragile vase topples downward as he yells a string of curses."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_25_OPTION_A,Attempt to catch the vase. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_25_OPTION_B,"With no time to react, watch the vase fall to the ground. "
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_25_RESULT_A_A,"You race forward and wrap your arms around the vase. You manage to keep grip of it, preventing tragedy. The Valrath is relieved and offers to pay you for your trouble if you carry it the rest of the way."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_25_RESULT_A_B,"You race forward and attempt to catch the vase, but it is too much for you. Your grip loosens and the vase shatters into a hundred pieces. The Valrath is irate, demanding compensation from you for breaking it. You pay him what you can."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_25_RESULT_B,"You watch helplessly as the vase careens out of the Valrath’s grasp and, once it connects with the hard ground, shatters into a hundred pieces. The Valrath looks distraught and a little angry. You exchange a sympathetic glance with him and then continue about your business."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_26_INTRO,"While enjoying your customary post-adventure drink at the Sleeping Lion, you notice something weird going on with the lamps in the bar.<br><br>Your first thought is that it is your imagination, but after staring at the lamps intently, you see they are flickering in and out. Tech lamps, as opposed to normal gas-burning ones, have been known to be a bit unreliable.<br><br>As if on cue, the lamps suddenly go out completely, leaving the room pitch-black."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_26_OPTION_A,Offer to fix the lamps. It shouldn't be too hard with a bit of technical know-how. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_26_OPTION_B,Take the opportunity to steal some valuables from drunk patrons in the dark. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_26_RESULT_A_A,You quickly identify the source of the problem—some frayed wiring in the kitchen—and have it replaced in no time. The proprietor seems very impressed by your work and gives free drinks all around in your name.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_26_RESULT_A_B,You fumble about magnanimously for a while before concluding that you have no idea what you’re doing. The proprietor looks disappointed and sends out for a real tinkerer.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_26_RESULT_B_A,"The darkness gives the less scrupulous among you a good chance to perform their craft. Within a matter of minutes, your coin purses are much heavier."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_26_RESULT_B_B,"You attempt to lighten some purses, but even in the dark, you find the task a little outside your skill set. One patron catches your hand as it searches his belt. He starts yelling, and you flee as quickly as possible."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_27_INTRO,"You are out in the Ward of Scales when you see a crowd of people forming to the south, growing louder and more dense by the second.<br><br>As you approach, you see through the angry mob a terrified Vermling being pulled in your direction by a group of gruff men.<br><br>“Dirty thief!” a woman next to you screams. “String it up!”<br><br>Glancing behind you to where the crowd appears to be headed, you see a disused gibbet in the market square.<br><br>The men—clearly not guards—move closer."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_27_OPTION_A,Attempt to stop the crowd from hanging the Vermling. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_27_OPTION_B,Take no action and see this through to its logical conclusion. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_27_RESULT_A_A,"You keep a calm demeanor as you try to talk down the mob. It takes some effort, but the men finally agree to turn the thief over to the authorities, which stops the situation from devolving into chaos."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_27_RESULT_A_B,"You kindly entreat the crowd to back down, and when that doesn’t work, you resort to force. No one seems happy that you stopped the hanging, but it was the right thing to do."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_27_RESULT_B,"You watch as the men move past you toward the gibbet. One carries a thick rope that he ties around the Vermling’s neck. The other end of the rope is thrown over the cross beam and then the men begin pulling, hoisting the helpless thief up off his feet. He struggles in vain, a panicked look in his eyes, but eventually he stops moving. The men tie off the rope, leaving the lifeless thief hanging. People begin to mill about, many stopping to spit on the ground before returning to work."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_28_INTRO,"Ah, the Sleeping Lion. Surely there is no better place to get a drink and relax after clearing out some dank dungeon.<br><br>On this particular occasion, though, you are approached by a heavily scarred Inox. She sits at your table and pushes forward a piece of paper.<br><br>“An interested party would like to hire you to steal a valuable figurine from a residence in the Battlements,” she says matter-of-factly. “The details are on the paper. Meet me in the back alley in two days’ time after the job is done.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_28_OPTION_A,Accept the mysterious job. You can handle anything. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_28_OPTION_B,Incredulously explain she must have the wrong people and you won't take the job. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_28_RESULT_A_A,"The job proves easy enough with the proper expertise. The plans are simple, and you are in and out of the estate easily, free to meet up with the Inox and claim your payment."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_28_RESULT_A_B,"It turns out confidence isn’t enough when it comes to sneaking in and out of a well-guarded estate without being seen. You didn’t get the figurine, and one of the guards got a pretty good look at you."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_28_RESULT_B,You grab the Inox’s arm as she is getting up to leave and push the paper back toward her. She looks incredibly angry as you explain that your group doesn’t do this sort of thing. She wordlessly grabs the plans and storms out of the bar.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_29_INTRO,"You get word from a contact that there is trouble brewing down at the East Walls and decide to investigate.<br><br>What you find is a large contingency of the city’s Savvas workforce—the best builders you’ll find anywhere—in open rebellion against the construction managers, demanding better pay for the specialized work they perform.<br><br>“This city would be a lifeless pile of rocks without us!” one of the Savvas yells. “It’s time we see some of its prosperity!”<br><br>The manager on the other side of the argument looks like a captured mouse, not sure at all how to get out of the situation."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_29_OPTION_A,"Talk to the Savvas, appealing to their sense of duty and community."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_29_OPTION_B,Talk to the managers and attempt to get the Savvas better pay.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_29_RESULT_A_A,"The workers’ hard expressions soften a bit when they see a Savvas among you. You talk for a while and explain that they need the city just as much as the city needs them. In the end, you sell them on a smaller wage increase, and everyone returns to work."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_29_RESULT_A_B,"Even after much effort, the workers won’t speak to you at all, calling you part of the problem. The strike is eventually resolved, but no one seems happy."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_29_RESULT_B_A,"“I-I just can’t give them more money!” the manager pleads. After some persuasion, though, he seems to open up to negotiation. The workers and management meet halfway and everyone seems content."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_29_RESULT_B_B,"You just can’t get the manager to budge on his position, and he only gets angrier with continued pushing. The Savvas eventually agree tentatively to continue work, but the underlying problem remains."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_2_INTRO,"As the daylight fades, you find yourselves wandering through a half-crowded market street, browsing wares.<br><br>“Hey! Over here!” You turn in the direction of the voice to see a filthy Vermling gesturing from a dark alley. “Yeah, you grim-looking chaps. I have something you might be interested in.”<br><br>The Vermling holds out a piece of metal covered in sludge. “Found this in the sewer. Writing on it I don’t understand, but I know it’s valuable. You can have it for ten gold!”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_2_OPTION_A,Pay for the thing. You never know. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_2_OPTION_B,Refuse to pay. Never trust a Vermling. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_2_RESULT_A_A,You hand over the gold and take hold of the piece of garbage. Amidst troubling brown smears you see a lot of meaningless scratches likely made by rats and bugs. Oh well. Sometimes the long shot doesn’t pay off.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_2_RESULT_A_B,“Bah! You don’t have enough. Come back when you do!”
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_2_RESULT_B,You laugh and gesture the Vermling away. You can recognize a low-life swindler when you see one. And that piece of garbage was just...foul.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_30_INTRO,"As you shop for supplies at the Sinking Market, your hand instinctively goes for the purse at your waist.<br><br>It’s gone!<br><br>You quickly scan the crowd and see a small Vermling darting away from you, heading directly toward a sewer grating."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_30_OPTION_A,Give chase! No one steals from you and gets away with it.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_30_OPTION_B,Take a clear shot at him with a bow before he disappears into the grating.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_30_RESULT_A_A,"The Vermling escapes into the sewers, but the Mindthief is able to give chase, catching up as the cutpurse enters his nest. There you find more wealth than what was lost."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_30_RESULT_A_B,"The Vermling disappears into the sewers, and you try to give chase. But after a few minutes you are hopelessly lost and are forced to give up."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_30_RESULT_B,"You raise your bow and take aim at the thief. A woman screams, but you try not to let it faze you. As the Vermling pauses to open the grate, you fire the arrow and see the furry figure drop. You smile and go to retrieve your gold from the corpse. You get a lot of dirty looks, though. Apparently firing a bow on a crowded street is frowned upon."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_31_INTRO,"You find yourself incredibly drunk and gambling away your hard-earned gold at the Brown Door when a robed woman approaches you.<br><br>“Please,” she says. “You must help me. They’ve taken my only daughter. I beg you!”<br><br>She slides a parchment toward you. “They left this behind...”<br><br>You look down to see nothing but the symbol of an upside-down black bird.<br><br>“The Ravens!” a man mutters. “Bad business.”<br><br>A bouncer approaches. “Take that garbage outside. You’re troubling the customers.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_31_OPTION_A,Leave with the woman to help her find her missing daughter.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_31_OPTION_B,Refuse to help the woman and go back to gambling.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_31_RESULT_A,"Once outside, the woman hands you a large pouch of gold. “My father saw the whole thing, but then he went mad and ran toward the Silent Bridge. Please find him and he’ll help you find my daughter!”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_31_RESULT_B_A,"You try to turn away the woman and get back to gambling, but the Sunkeeper won’t hear of it. She forces you to follow the woman outside."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_31_RESULT_B_B,"You return to your gambling, but you feel as though a pall has fallen over the revelry. Your luck has turned, and you end the night much poorer than when you started."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_32_INTRO,"As you return to town after your latest adventure, a highranking guard approaches and gestures you to the side of the road.<br><br>“I am embarrassed to admit this,” he begins in a low voice, “but we could really use some help. With all the attacks recently and very little support from the capital, the city guard finds itself woefully lacking in both equipment and training for the new recruits.”<br><br>The guard looks you over. “You are experienced warriors, and anything you could do to help the situation would be greatly appreciated.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_32_OPTION_A,Agree to help the city guard. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_32_OPTION_B,Decline to help and instead sell this information on to interested parties. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_32_RESULT_A_A,"You not only help to train the new recruits, but the Quartermaster is able to repair a lot of the guards’ damaged armor and weaponry. At the end of the day, the city is very pleased with your contribution."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_32_RESULT_A_B,"You spend the day training the new recruits. By the time the sun goes down, their skills are much improved, and they are grateful to you because of it."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_32_RESULT_B,"Whenever there is bad news, there is always someone who delights in it and profits from it. Who would be happy to hear the city guards are having trouble? Thieves. And they pay surprisingly well for the information."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_33_INTRO,"The Void is a troubling area in Gloomhaven—a vast, barren expanse of black sand amid the bustling streets of the city. No one enters its perimeter.<br><br>On a trip to the University, however, you see a young girl playing near the edge of the Void. Before you can warn her, she trips and falls onto the sand. She immediately emits a blood-curdling scream and begins to tear at her skin."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_33_OPTION_A,Run to the girl and attempt to pull her out of the Void.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_33_OPTION_B,Watch what happens with morbid curiosity.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_33_RESULT_A_A,"You grab the child and lift her clear of the haunting area. She is still screaming madly when the Aesther in your group lays a hand upon the child in deep concentration. Slowly, the crying subsides, and the child gets up and runs off."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_33_RESULT_A_B,"You get the child off the sand as quickly as you can, but it doesn’t do much good. The girl screams and screams no matter what aid is administered."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_33_RESULT_B,"Unable to resist, you watch to see what will happen to the girl. Her skin turns ashen and begins to flake away. She stops screaming eventually and begins coughing up a black bile. She tries to stand, but her legs crumble away into dust. She makes a pitiful croak and then falls over into a cloud of sand. When the cloud settles, no evidence of her presence remains."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_34_INTRO,"After a night of revelry at the Sleeping Lion, you head out into the streets and notice a suspicious man in black robes skulking toward an alleyway.<br><br>You’ve been hearing reports about a cult inside the city, calling themselves the Ravens and performing all sort of terrible acts. Perhaps this is one of them."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_34_OPTION_A,Follow the man in an attempt to discover the Ravens' lair.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_34_OPTION_B,Confront him on the spot and turn him over to the authorities. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_34_RESULT_A_A,"Using the night like a cloak, you follow the man unseen and unheard. Eventually he stops at a small dwelling nestled under the west wall of the city."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_34_RESULT_A_B,"You sneak forward, confident in your stealth abilities. After a few minutes, though, the man suddenly bolts around a corner. By the time you get there, he is long gone."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_34_RESULT_B,"Not confident in your stealth abilities, you decide speed and force are a better way to go. You charge forward, catching the man completely by surprise. You block off all avenues of escape and surround him. He snarls as you tie him up and hand him over to the city guards. Hopefully they’ll be able to get some useful information out of him."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_35_INTRO,"Harrowers are a rare sight, both outside of Gloomhaven and within. Which explains why you are bit surprised when you find yourself standing before three Harrowers in ornate robes unlike any you’ve ever seen.<br><br>“We require spices from across the sea,” one chitters at you. “Can you direct us to the appropriate merchant?”<br><br>A bit caught off guard, you ask about the specific kind of spice, but the Harrower makes only unintelligible hisses.<br><br>“It is hard to describe. We will know it when we see it. It is very important to our hive.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_35_OPTION_A,Point the way to the Sinking Market—the only place that would deal with them.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_35_OPTION_B,Escort the Harrowers to the New Market and help them find a spice merchant.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_35_RESULT_A,"You quickly point in the direction of the Sinking Market, assuring the Harrowers they will find exactly what they need there. They chitter and hand you a gold piece, then move on their way."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_35_RESULT_B_A,"You make your way to the market with the Harrowers in tow. It’s easy to find a reputable spice merchant, but difficult to get the merchant and the Harrowers to trust each other. In the end, they find common ground through the Plagueherald and make a deal."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_35_RESULT_B_B,"You bring the Harrowers to the market, but even after great effort, you cannot find any merchants willing to deal with them. They depart empty-handed."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_36_INTRO,"You decide to unwind at the Sleeping Lion, but just as you are starting to relax, a bear of a man crashes into your table, scattering your drinks across the floor.<br><br>Towering over him is a massive Inox. “What did you say about my horns?” the Inox shouts. The man stands up and brushes shards of glass from his tunic. “I said the sight of them makes me want to vomit!”<br><br>The Inox roars and charges headlong into the man, crashing through more tables in the process. At this, the entire tavern erupts into violence. After all, when a man is deep into his drink, the last thing you want to do is knock that drink over."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_36_OPTION_A,Join the fray! These insults will not go unanswered!
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_36_OPTION_B,Do your best to stop the fighting. This is a respectable establishment.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_36_RESULT_A_A,"You break a chair over the man’s back, kick him in the teeth, and then you really get into it. It’s a bar brawl that could only be described as “epic,” fueled by pure, raw rage. The carnage is extreme."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_36_RESULT_A_B,"You jump into the melee, breaking heads and chairs in equal measure. You’ve seen worse brawls, but the proprietor still isn’t very happy when it’s over."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_36_RESULT_B_A,"You get up to calm down the room, but the Berserker has other ideas, laying into the man before you can get a word out. She goes into a furious rage, and there’s really not much to be done about it except pay what you can for the damages afterward."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_36_RESULT_B_B,"It takes some work, but you manage to calm down the Inox and buy off the rest of the room with some extra drinks. The proprietor looks positively relieved."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_37_INTRO,"As you return to town after your latest adventure, you see smoke rising from the walls of the city. You enter the broken gates and see a scene of despair as the citizens of Gloomhaven recover from a catastrophic attack.<br><br>“Demons,” a wounded guard at the gate says. “Wish you lot could have been around to help fight them off. Now look at the place. Luckily the rest of the city remained safe.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_37_OPTION_A,Attempt to console and cheer up those affected by the attack.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_37_OPTION_B,Help repair the gate. You wouldn’t want another attack to further cripple the town.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_37_RESULT_A_A,"The citizens are downtrodden, but the uncanny power of the Soothsinger’s music seems to lift their spirits considerably. Still far from cheerful, the people find new resolve in repairing the damage and rebuilding."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_37_RESULT_A_B,"The citizens view you with a cynical eye as you walk around, attempting to encourage them and lift their spirits. Despite the effort, it seems as though they are in a worse mood than when you arrived."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_37_RESULT_B_A,"You set to work repairing the gate, and by the time night falls, it is at least functional. The downtrodden citizens are inspired by your work, and you have little doubt that the community will bounce back with little permanent damage."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_37_RESULT_B_B,You fiddle with the gate for a bit until it becomes clear that you are doing nothing to help. You decide to head back to your rooms instead and get some rest.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_38_INTRO,"Walking through the crowded streets of the Ward of Scales, you suddenly hear a commotion behind you. You turn to see a gruff shirtless man badgering a male Orchid.<br><br>“I assure you, I did nothing of the sort,” the Orchid says calmly.<br><br>“You calling me a liar now?” bellows the man. “I think somebody needs to teach you a lesson.” The man careens forward with his fist and knocks the Orchid to the ground.<br><br>A gasp emerges from the crowd, but very quickly the attitude turns to excitement and encouragement. Nothing like a good fight to get a crowd worked up."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_38_OPTION_A,Intervene on the Orchid’s behalf.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_38_OPTION_B,Watch the fight with the crowd.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_38_RESULT_A_A,"The Orchid on the ground puts up no defense, but your group is a different matter. The man quickly backs down at the sight of a powerful Orchid ready to attack, and the crowd disperses, muttering disappointment."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_38_RESULT_A_B,"You try to talk some sense into the man, and when that doesn’t work, you beat him senseless. The crowd seems happy and the Orchid thanks you for your aid."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_38_RESULT_B_A,"After a good beating, the crowd is riled up. Many people start looking in your direction, muttering about how you have the nerve to associate with Orchids as well. You make a quick exit."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_38_RESULT_B_B,"The Orchid puts up no defense and the “fight” becomes rather one-sided. A solid beating is administered, and the crowd is sated. You go about your business while the Orchid bleeds on the ground."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_39_INTRO,"You are awakened in your room by a decisive knock at the door. You answer it to find a man in the robes of the Great Oak.<br><br>“Greetings,” the man begins. “Our sanctuary is having a bit of trouble, and I’ve been directed to you as persons who could possibly help.<br><br>“You see, some of our relics have gone missing, and we suspect the worst. We are hoping you might grace us with your assistance in investigating this matter.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_39_OPTION_A,Agree to help the priest and accompany him to the sanctuary.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_39_OPTION_B,"Refuse to help, making some excuse about being too busy."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_39_RESULT_A,"The pious man seems incredibly happy you’ve decided to help the sanctuary. When you arrive at the great building, he explains in detail all that has happened. Using that information, you inquire around town, putting out feelers to possible fences for the goods."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_39_RESULT_B,"You mutter something about hunting drakes and close the door on the priest. He becomes rather distraught as the door slams shut in his face, but surely he’ll get over it. You’ve got much more important things to do anyway."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_3_INTRO,"As the daylight fades, you find yourselves wandering through a half-crowded market street, browsing wares.<br><br>“Hey! Over here!” You turn in the direction of the voice to see a filthy Vermling gesturing from a dark alley. “Yeah, you grim-looking chaps.

EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_3_OPTION_A,Pay for the thing. You never know. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_3_OPTION_B,Refuse to pay. Never trust a Vermling. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_3_RESULT_A_A,"You hand over the gold and take hold of the metal. You wipe off the grime and slop to discover a foreign contraption made of large gears and many moving parts. If you can figure out what it is, this device might actually be of some worth."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_3_RESULT_A_B,“Bah! You don’t have enough. Come back when you do!”
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_3_RESULT_B,You laugh and gesture the Vermling away. You can recognize a low-life swindler when you see one. And that piece of garbage was just...foul.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_40_INTRO,"You are shopping for supplies in the Boiler’s District when an intense explosion knocks you off your feet.<br><br>You look in the direction of the heat waves to see plumes of fire and smoke rising from a building less than a block a way.<br><br>The fire rages uncontrollably and there are many wounded residents laying near the blast, screaming in pain.<br><br>You also spot something else—a hooded figure in a dark robe fleeing from the scene."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_40_OPTION_A,Rush to the aid of the residents and help put out the fire.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_40_OPTION_B,Pursue the hooded figure and make him answer for this attack.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_40_RESULT_A_A,"Some of your group immediately begin to tend to the wounded, bandaging cuts and administering potions."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_40_RESULT_A_B,"Some of your group begin to control the fire and snuff it with their elemental prowess, preventing further damage."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_40_RESULT_A_C,"You do your best, but without the proper skills, it isn’t much."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_40_RESULT_B,"You jump to your feet and sprint as fast as you can in pursuit. The figure races toward the city wall and begins to climb the stairs. You close the gap, but look on in frustration as he moves to jump over the wall and out of the city. You lunge and grab his robe as he falls. His body twists awkwardly, freeing him of the robe. You look over the edge to see him land face-first on the ground and not get up."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_41_INTRO,"The Sinking Market is a varied area of decrepit huts and merchants unable to sell their wares anywhere else. It doesn’t surprise you as you walk through to see a scraggly Vermling approach with a small sack.<br><br>“A potion for the big, strong adventurers!” she says as she waves you down. “Help you in battle, it will!”<br><br>You are about to push her aside and keep walking when she pulls the potion out of the sack. It glows green in the daylight—an impressive, large flask of master craftsmanship.<br><br>“Aha, I knew it catch your eye! How much you pay?”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_41_OPTION_A,Barter with the Vermling for the potion.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_41_OPTION_B,Move along. You don’t need any more potions.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_41_RESULT_A_A,"The Vermling knows it is valuable, but she is more interested in flirting with the Beast Tyrant. She is happy to sell the potion at a discount."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_41_RESULT_A_B,No amount of haggling can lower the Vermling’s high price.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_41_RESULT_A_C,The Vermling will not accept the tiny sum you offer. Maybe next time.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_41_RESULT_B,"Shaking your head, you move past the Vermling and get back to your business. She begins to make sobbing sounds behind you. “But, but you die without potion! Is life worth nothing?”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_42_INTRO,"Walking near the West Gate, you are approached by a scrawny kid in a guard uniform, which is clearly too big for his small frame.<br><br>“Hey, you all are famous!” he says with a big smile. “I worked as a caravan guard before I got this job. Met with a big Inox guy who always talked about you. He made you seem like the nicest, most amazing people.”<br><br>His smile and excitement doesn’t waver. “Say, my detail is doing some work to repair the wall damage from the last Vermling attack. Would you mind helping us? It’ll be fun!”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_42_OPTION_A,Agree to help the presumptuous kid.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_42_OPTION_B,Tell this kid that he must have the wrong group of adventurers.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_42_RESULT_A,"It’s hard work, but the kid’s enthusiasm is infectious. He wants to know all about your exploits and adventures, and he and his detail prove to be a great audience. By the end of the day, it hardly feels like you’ve worked at all."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_42_RESULT_B,You shake your head and avert your gaze. You claim that the kid must have you confused with a different adventuring party. He looks crushed as you walk away.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_43_INTRO,"You return to your rooms for the evening to find a small note resting on the ground in front of your door.<br><br>It is from the Tinkerer, explaining that he has been pursuing further studies in flammable liquid delivery methods. He asks for your help in delivering to him a small robotic contraption that he absentmindedly left behind in a secret stash under the floorboards of his old room.<br><br>He details the device’s location and gives an address to deliver it to—some small village far to the northwest."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_43_OPTION_A,Oblige the Tinkerer and send along the contraption.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_43_OPTION_B,You don’t want to pay for postage. Just keep the thing for yourself.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_43_RESULT_A_A,"Sure enough, under the floorboards of his old room, you find a bunch of parts, tools, and an intricately crafted metal spider. You package it up and ship it off to the Tinkerer. Anything for an old friend."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_43_RESULT_A_B,"You don’t have the money to send him the contraption, so you decide just to keep it for yourself."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_43_RESULT_B,"Like an eager treasure hunter, you pry up the floorboards in the Tinkerer’s old room and find a trove of useless junk, plus a detailed robotic spider that is anything but useless. You switch it on and let it scurry around the room. This could be a significant help in battle. No way it’s getting shipped off."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_44_INTRO,"In the very early morning, you are wakened by a knock at your door. Standing behind it is giant, dirty Inox wearing a leather apron.<br><br>“Oh, uh...ahem,” he coughs. “Sorry, I was looking for a female Orchid. She used to help me on occasion with my forge. Her control over fire was astounding and I paid her well for her assistance completing some of my specialty work.”<br><br>He scratches his head. “I guess she’s not around anymore. You wouldn’t happen to know where I could find someone who could help me in her absence, would you?”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_44_OPTION_A,Offer to help the blacksmith yourself.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_44_OPTION_B,Direct him to the Savvas Elemental Guild and go back to sleep.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_44_RESULT_A_A,"Despite the early hour, you head down to the Inox’s forge and get an incredibly strong fire going for him so he can complete his order. He seems very pleased."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_44_RESULT_A_B,The Inox is completely dumbfounded when you walk all the way down to his forge and then proceed to exhibit zero aptitude at manipulating or controlling fire.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_44_RESULT_B,"“Ah, yes, that is probably a good idea,” he says. “Thanks for your time and I hope your friend the Spellweaver is doing well!”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_45_INTRO,"“You there! Stop!”<br><br>You turn to see a city guard walking briskly toward you.<br><br>“You are known associates of this woman, yes?” He holds up a crude sketch of the Scoundrel. “We believe she is behind a number of high-profile robberies and demand that you give us any information you have on her whereabouts and activities.”<br><br>His face softens a bit. “Look, I know you guys do a lot of good for the city, but the merchant guild is breathing down my neck on this one, and I could really use a lead.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_45_OPTION_A,Cooperate with the guard and tell him everything you know.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_45_OPTION_B,"Be as vague and unhelpful as possible, giving no useful information."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_45_RESULT_A,"The guard taps his notes with a smile on his face.<br><br>“This is great,” he says. “I understand that you haven’t seen her in a while, but the information you’ve provided should still be useful. Have a nice day!”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_45_RESULT_B,"The guard scratches his head and looks down at his notes.<br><br>“Well, that wasn’t very helpful,” he sighs. “But thanks for your time, I guess. Let me know if you remember anything or get any new information.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_46_INTRO,"Anticipating an enjoyable night of drinks at the Sleeping Lion, you enter the tavern to see a familiar Savvas sitting at your usual table. The Cragheart stands and extends both its arms.<br><br>“Ah, friends! So good to see you,” it says. “Sit! Have a drink with me!”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_46_OPTION_A,Have a drink with the Cragheart. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_46_OPTION_B,Encourage the Cragheart to move on with its life.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_46_RESULT_A,"One drink turns into five, and five turns into even more. It is a great night of revelry at the Sleeping Lion. You see sadness in the Cragheart’s eyes when you finally stand up to leave. It tells you it’s been hard to find people to relate to since leaving the party and it thanks you for your continued friendship."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_46_RESULT_B,"Not fitting in with its own kind or with a city of mostly humans, the Cragheart thought it could depend on a misfit group of mercenaries for friendship. It understands that its adventuring life is now in the past, though, and that it should go find a new place to belong. It sadly admits that it has no idea where that would be, but the Cragheart gets up and leaves the tavern nonetheless."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_47_INTRO,"Walking near Gloomhaven Square, you see a peculiar scene. A group of guards is dragging along a Vermling in tattered robes toward the Ghost Fortress. Getting a little closer, you<br>recognize the Mindthief.<br><br>“Hssss,” she spits. “Why do you do this? I came to you! I tell you that this town is being poisoned, and you respond by imprisoning me?”<br><br>“We’ll see what the Captain of the Guard has to say about this,” one of her captors says. “Keep moving!”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_47_OPTION_A,Intervene with the guards and find out what is going on.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_47_OPTION_B,Let the guards continue their business and just continue with yours.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_47_RESULT_A,"The guards look incredibly perturbed when you step in front of them and ask that they leave the Mindthief to you. After some effort, they begrudgingly hand her over. The Mindthief thanks you, explaining that her colony in the sewers is being poisoned, and the poison is quickly migrating to the city’s water supply. She says she’s tracked the source to a small cove along the Hook Coast."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_47_RESULT_B,"The Mindthief flicks her tail and throws insults around, but it doesn’t seem to have any positive effect. She is led away and out of view. You get about your business, hoping that bit about the town being poisoned wasn’t too serious."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_48_INTRO,"You are haggling over the price of road rations with an irritating Valrath merchant when a messenger boy approaches you holding a note.<br><br>“Sir, I have a pressing letter from an important Valrath Sunkeeper,” the messenger says. “I was told to deliver it to you.”<br><br>You reach for it, but the messenger moves back a little. “Sir, this note has traveled a long distance to get to you. If you could, please pay a small fee to take possession of it.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_48_OPTION_A,Begrudgingly pay for the note.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_48_OPTION_B,Refuse to pay for the note.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_48_RESULT_A_A,You throw the kid a few coins and grab the note. Enclosed with the note is a small medallion engraved with the image of the sun. Apparently the Sunkeeper thinks the object may help you at some point in the future. The note doesn’t say exactly how and the thing has no apparent use. You stow it away in your pack.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_48_RESULT_A_B,"You reach into your pocket to pay the kid, but come up empty-handed. He slinks off in indignation."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_48_RESULT_B,"You laugh in indignation and push the messenger away. He opens his mouth to object, then thinks better of it and runs off. You turn back to bartering, now leveraging the proof of your extreme thriftiness against the merchant."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_49_INTRO,"“Your Quartermaster friend sent me.” You look quizzically at the Valrath standing at your door.<br><br>“I’m from the Capital, and I deal in arms and armor,” he says. “I’m looking to set up a contract with the Gloomhaven military, and our friend says that you may have some contacts with them. He suggested I meet up with you once I got here.”<br><br>The Valrath shifts his feet nervously. “So, can you help me?”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_49_OPTION_A,Agree to help him make contact with the military.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_49_OPTION_B,Demand a finder’s fee for setting him up with buyers.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_49_RESULT_A,"You take the Valrath over to the Ghost Fortress, where you make introductions to the Captain of the Guard. The Captain seems skeptical at first, but admits that they could use an additional supply of weapons. Terms are made, and a contract is signed."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_49_RESULT_B_A,"The Valrath looks at you with trepidation, but after some persuasion, you get him to agree."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_49_RESULT_B_B,"The Valrath recoils, insulted by the notion. He storms off, grumbling about the lost value of friendship."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_4_INTRO,"Having recently returned from your latest adventure, you are approached by a ratty-looking boy in tears.<br><br>“Please, sirs, could you please help me with my cat? He went over there, and I’m afraid.” The boy points a dirty finger at a decrepit, abandoned building. “I don’t know what else to do.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_4_OPTION_A,Find a cat? You have more important things to do. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_4_OPTION_B,Reassure the boy and go find the cat. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_4_RESULT_A,You shake your head and direct the boy to go find his mother. With any luck she will knock some sense into him so that he stops troubling strangers with such trivial matters.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_4_RESULT_B,"You approach the foreboding house full of heroic bravado. There’s certainly nothing otherworldly about the structure, but its fallen beams and piles of rubble do make it difficult to look around. By the time you find the cat hiding under a burned-out bed frame, you are utterly exhausted. At least the boy is ecstatic his cat has been found."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_50_INTRO,"“A monstrous creature approaches the walls!” A guard with a truly terrified look runs toward you, waving his arms with manic energy. “Please! You must help!” Before you can even agree, he grabs you by the wrist and pulls you toward the East Gate.<br><br>You hear the beast before you see it, bellowing with rage and pounding at the gates. Each time it hits, the entire city shakes. You climb the ramparts and look down at the massive creature with six legs as thick as trees, two spiraling horns, and a spiked tail.<br><br>“This is truly a demon from the abyss,” the guard laments. It must be from another plane, so he’s not too far off."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_50_OPTION_A,"Attack the beast from the wall, shooting arrows at it until it stops moving."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_50_OPTION_B,Work on reinforcing the walls. Hold it off for as long as possible.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_50_RESULT_A,"You grab a bow and start sending arrows down into the thing’s thick hide. Each individual arrow doesn’t do much, but over time the creature slows. By the time it manages to break through the gate, it has been considerably hobbled as black blood pours from its countless wounds. It charges forward, laying waste to a small shop, but as more arrows continue to rain down upon it, it soon stops and falls over lifeless."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_50_RESULT_B,"You set to work reinforcing the gate with anything you can find—planks of wood, carts full of stones, your own bodies. Due to your tremendous effort, the guards on the walls manage to bring down the beast before it breaks through. The various merchants of the Boiler’s District thank you for your valiant service."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_51_INTRO,"You are wandering through the city streets late at night when you hear a terrifying scream high above you. You look up just in time to see a body falling toward you and jump out of the way.<br><br>It lands with a wet thud on the ground. You were not the only ones to hear the scream, and quickly a small crowd forms around the corpse, including a couple of city guards.<br><br>The body is clad in black leather armor, and a long, thin blade conspicuously protrudes from its back. You remark that the sword somehow looks familiar.<br><br>“What?” asks a guard. “This is the third murder like this in a week. Tell me everything you know!”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_51_OPTION_A,"Tell the guard that the sword belongs to the Nightshroud, your former party member."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_51_OPTION_B,Lie and claim you know nothing.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_51_RESULT_A,"You explain that you recognize the sword from the time you spent traveling with the Nightshroud. As a capable assassin, he is likely to be the one behind the murders. You explain, however, that since he left the group, you have no knowledge of his whereabouts or dealings. The guard thanks you for the information."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_51_RESULT_B_A,"You shake your head at the guard, saying you must have been mistaken. You thought the sword looked similar to one carried by a friend, but, looking closer, there are distinct differences. The guard shrugs and goes back to examining the scene."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_51_RESULT_B_B,You laugh and make up some poor explanation about seeing a similar sword on a bandit in a crypt. The guard eyes you suspiciously.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_52_INTRO,"You have been hearing rumors in the bars: a pox is spreading through Gloomhaven, affecting lower class citizens—street urchins and backalley thugs.<br><br>And then one night you see it: a Harrower dressed in a ragged green cloak holding a man down in an alley as its swarm spreads out and consumes him. The man’s screams are muffled as the insects skitter down his throat.<br><br>Killing monsters and demons is one thing, but the Plagueherald shouldn’t be preying on people in the city. You approach it, intent on stopping its attack."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_52_OPTION_A,"Calmly explain the situation to the Plagueherald, imploring it to move on."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_52_OPTION_B,Threaten the Plagueherald with retribution if it doesn’t stop attacking residents.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_52_RESULT_A,"With the man dead at its feet, the Plagueherald makes a chittering sound that sounds almost like laughing.<br><br>“You cannot see it, but this city needs to be cleansed. You will see, and you will thank me.”<br><br>At this, the Plagueherald bursts out into a massive swarm of insects and flies up into the sky.<br><br>The deaths continue, and new rumors start about how you are associated with the killer."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_52_RESULT_B,"The Plagueherald recoils at your threat, genuinely concerned that you would attack it.<br><br>“But, the cleansing...the city isn’t ready.”<br><br>You shake your head, and the Harrower chitters in disappointment.<br><br>“Very well, but you will be responsible when the Harbinger comes.” It turns and floats off into the darkness."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_53_INTRO,"Walking near the northern gates, you see some commotion as a group of wounded guards is ushered into town.<br><br>They look pretty bad off, suffering from many severe wounds. Some even have lost limbs.<br><br>Bringing up the rear, one guard is carried in by a couple of others. He’s missing a leg and has a vicious-looking axe embedded in his side. You realize that the axe looks kind of familiar."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_53_OPTION_A,Let the guards know you recognize the Berserker’s axe.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_53_OPTION_B,Stay silent and keep out of it.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_53_RESULT_A,"You approach the wounded detail, explaining how that axe belonged to a former member of your party.<br><br>“Yeah, we know,” one of them says with an icy stare. “Said we were desecrating her land or some such nonsense and just went crazy. But we weren’t doing anything but patrolling! Quite a piece of work your friend. Just take the axe if you want and get out of here.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_53_RESULT_B,"You casually move on, wondering how the guards found themselves on the wrong side of the Berserker’s rage. It probably wasn’t very difficult."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_54_INTRO,"Posters spring up in town announcing the performance of a master Quatryl musician and her merry band of performers. Looking closely at the image, you’re pretty sure you recognize that foppish feathered hat.<br><br>The poster says the next show is tonight. You decide to attend for one purpose or another."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_54_OPTION_A,Go to the show and cheer on the Soothsinger.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_54_OPTION_B,Seems like a good opportunity to pick some pockets while people are distracted.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_54_RESULT_A,You go and enjoy the Soothsinger’s concert immensely. There is even a song or two about your party and its adventures around Gloomhaven.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_54_RESULT_B_A,The rubes are much too distracted to mind their coin purses. You make off with a good amount of cash and get to listen to some nice music as well.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_54_RESULT_B_B,"You put forth a valiant effort, but, due to a lack of skill, you don’t make much headway parting people from their money. At least the music is good."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_55_INTRO,"“Ah, they said I might find you here.” A portly Valrath woman looks down at you as you are enjoying a cold beverage at the Sleeping Lion.<br><br>“A group of wild-looking Orchids came to the Temple of Coin today hoping to engage in trade with the merchants of the city. One particularly dour-looking one with a bow said you lot would vouch for them.<br><br>“We’re always wary of traps and betrayal out here on the edge of the wilds, but if you think these Orchids can be trusted, then the Merchant’s Guild may consider opening trade with them.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_55_OPTION_A,Vouch for the Orchids.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_55_OPTION_B,Advise against trading with the Orchids.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_55_RESULT_A,"“Well, we’ll take it under advisement. Personally, I don’t even know why your opinion matters, but some people in the Merchant’s Guild seem to like you.<br><br>“Anyway, feel free to get back to your life of consumption and murder.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_55_RESULT_B,"The Valrath woman nods. “I agree. Orchids are not to be trusted. Personally, I thought you lacked the brains to make a proper decision, but I’m happy to be proven wrong.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_56_INTRO,"Looking for a little bit of variety, you head down to the Brown Door as night falls. After some wait, you pass through the doors and are surprised to see the Sawbones sitting near the back of the room by himself. Considering this bar is about as seedy and corrupt as they come, it is just about the last place you would expect to find him.<br><br>“I just...I don’t know what to do now,” the Sawbones confesses after you sit down. “I’d like to join the sanctuary and lead a nice, quiet life, but after adventuring with all of you, that just doesn’t seem fulfilling anymore.”<br><br>He shakes his head. “I don’t know. This life seems so boring now. What do you think?”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_56_OPTION_A,Tell him that joining the sanctuary is the right thing to do.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_56_OPTION_B,Tell him to follow his dreams.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_56_RESULT_A,"“I guess you’re right,” he shrugs. “Here’s to one last night of freedom.” He lifts his glass and gulps down the contents. You follow his lead and the rest is a blur."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_56_RESULT_B,"“You’re right! I’m in command of my own life, and I’m going to do what I want with it. Maybe I’ll go to the Capital and start my own business or something. Who knows?”<br><br>He lifts his glass and looks at you. “To endless possibilities! The next round’s on me.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_57_INTRO,"You are haggling over the price of road rations with an irritating Valrath merchant when a messenger boy approaches you holding a note.<br><br>“Sir, I have a pressing letter written by a powerful Savvas that has come to you from all the way across the Misty Sea,” the messenger says. “I was told to deliver it directly.”<br><br>You reach for it, but the messenger moves back a little. “Sir, this note has traveled a very long distance to get to you. If you could, please pay a small fee to take possession of it.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_57_OPTION_A,Pay for the note. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_57_OPTION_B,Refuse to pay for the note. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_57_RESULT_A_A,"You open the note to discover it is from the Elementalist, who has sailed to the eastern continent to gain a deeper understanding of the elements. During this time, the Elementalist also spent some effort on the construction of a powerful staff and wanted to share the design."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_57_RESULT_A_B,"You reach into your pocket to pay the kid, but come up empty-handed. He slinks off in indignation."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_57_RESULT_B,"You laugh in indignation and push the messenger away. He opens his mouth to object, then thinks better of it and runs off. You turn back to bartering, now leveraging the proof of your extreme thriftiness against the merchant."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_58_INTRO,"“There were fifty of them, I swear. Tearing my mates apart!”<br><br>You look over to the bar where a group of drunkards are all laughing at a disheveled man in the middle of a story.<br><br>“And commanding them all, riding atop a giant armored bear, there was a Vermling with a staff that shot lightning!”<br><br>At this the crowd erupts into more laughter, drowning out the rest of the man’s story. “This man’s had too much to drink, I’d say,” ridicules one of the crowd. “Vermlings riding bears! I thought I’d heard of everything!”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_58_OPTION_A,Join the crowd in laughing at the man. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_58_OPTION_B,Calm down the crowd and get more details from the man about the attack. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_58_RESULT_A,"You move closer and join in on the fun. After a while, the man gives up and resigns himself to his glass. But his story provides entertainment for weeks."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_58_RESULT_B,"It’s not easy, but you quiet down the crowd and take the staggering man over to a secluded corner of the tavern to get the full story out of him. Apparently he was part of a group of ruffians working to harvest the Dagger Forest for wood. In the middle of their logging expedition, however, they were attacked by the Beast Tyrant and an army of forest animals. Though he ran off in the middle of the fight, the man swears he also heard the howl of angry spirits in the chaos."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_59_INTRO,"You head to the Sinking Market, hoping to find some cheap supplies, when you are surprised to see a crowd gathering in the distance. You push your way through and see a host of dead bodies in the street, covered in insects and strange pustules in their skin.<br><br>Nearby, a woman screams in terror and runs away. Other more curious onlookers inch closer, trying to get a better view of the grotesque scene."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_59_OPTION_A,Help to dispose of the corpses as quickly as possible. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_59_OPTION_B,Investigate the corpses. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_59_RESULT_A,"Finding it probable that these corpses harbor some sort of disease, you ward everyone away while you carefully load the bodies onto a cart, take them outside the city, and burn them.<br><br>The crowd is a little disappointed that you took away the morning entertainment. Especially annoyed are the guards, who don’t appreciate you disposing of dead bodies before they can investigate them."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_59_RESULT_B,"Curiosity gets the better of you, as well, and you approach the corpses with morbid fascination, hoping to find some clue about what happened. The number of insects is alarming, as is the diseased nature of the skin. If you had to guess, a Harrower could be responsible, or perhaps Xorn, who you so helpfully revived. Over the next few days, the disease spreads throughout the Sinking Market, killing many more people."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_5_INTRO,"After resting for the evening, you start out your day noticing a great number of prominent, commanding posters around the city.<br><br>Reading one, you learn that the Sanctuary of the Great Oak is laying down the foundation for a new building on the east side of Gloomhaven. Everyone is encouraged to come and help. This could be an important community event."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_5_OPTION_A,Go help lay the foundation.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_5_OPTION_B,Take the opportunity to steal some valuables in the area while people are distracted. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_5_RESULT_A,"Amidst a great deal of revelry, you put all you have into laying the foundation of the sanctuary. Surely much good will be done here healing the sick and wounded. After all your exhaustive efforts, though, you might end up being their first patients."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_5_RESULT_B,"You head to the prosperous east side of town, not to help lay down the foundation, but to steal some goods from shopkeepers too silly to lock up their wares during the festivities. You make off with a good deal of money and the distracted guards are none the wiser."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_60_INTRO,"You are wandering the Ward of Scales in the evening when a crowd of people begins to form outside one of the shops, growing louder and more dense by the second.<br><br>As you approach, you see a terrified family of Quatryls through a familiar angry mob. The father pleads with a group of disheveled men with torches.<br><br>“Cheats!” A woman next to you screams. “Burn the store down!”<br><br>One of the men—clearly not a guard—backhands the father away from the door and pushes his way inside the shop."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_60_OPTION_A,Attempt to stop the men from burning down the shop.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_60_OPTION_B,Take part in the looting and burning of the store.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_60_RESULT_A_A,"You push your way to the front of the mob and stop the men as they enter the store. Clearly emotions have gotten the better of these people. Through a calm demeanor, you are able to talk the mob down. A sense of relief washes over the crowd."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_60_RESULT_A_B,"You kindly entreat the crowd to back down. It gets a little rough, but it becomes clear the crowd isn’t fully into it. After knocking a few heads, the mob disperses."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_60_RESULT_B,"You watch as one of the men picks up a wooden crate and throws it through the shop window. In a frenzy, the crowd rushes into the store, breaking and looting with mad glee. It’s easy enough to move in with the crowd and pick up a few valuable items in the chaos. After you get clear of the crowd, you look back to see billows of smoke rising up from the door and broken window. Not a good day to be a Quatryl."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_61_INTRO,"The day proves uneventful until you head back to your room in the evening to find a small package waiting at your doorstep. Resting on it is another note from the Tinkerer.<br><br>He thanks you profusely for sending along the mechanical spider, saying it was a great help in his work. He doesn’t need it any longer, however, and decided to send it back.<br><br>He explains that he made a few improvements to it as well while it was in his possession, and that it should help you significantly in your adventures."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_61_OPTION_A,Gratefully keep the spider. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_61_OPTION_B,"You can't decide who should keep it, so sell the spider and split the money. "
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_61_RESULT_A,"You open the package to find a much larger but equally intricate robotic spider staring back at you. This one appears to specialize in scurrying around its user, picking up and returning anything that might have been dropped. Should prove useful."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_61_RESULT_B,"You head down to the Mixed District with the newly improved spider and barter with some Quatryls who seem incredibly impressed with the craftsmanship. After some back-and-forth, you walk away with a nice sum of gold coins."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_62_INTRO,"“So, I hear you stood up for me with the city guards the other day. Such annoying pests, aren’t they?”<br><br>You turn around in the street to see the Scoundrel emerge from a dark alley with a smile on her face.<br><br>“I just wanted to thank you in person,” she says. “I’ve known quite a few persons who would have ratted me out for their chance at a piece of gold. It’s good to know some friendships last.”<br><br>She looks over her shoulder. “Listen, I’m leaving town for a good long while. You wanna grab a drink before I take off?”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_62_OPTION_A,Have a drink and reminisce about old times.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_62_OPTION_B,Overpower the Scoundrel and deliver her to the city guards.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_62_RESULT_A,"You laugh for a while and trade tales. As the sun drops below the tavern windows, the Scoundrel gets up to leave.<br><br>“Listen, I really did enjoy our time together, and, well, I just wanted to leave you with something to remember me by.”<br><br>A piece of black cloth flutters down onto the table. When you look back up, the Scoundrel is gone."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_62_RESULT_B,"A look of horrid surprise flashes in the Scoundrel’s eyes as you leap forward and throw her to the ground. She doesn’t even speak as you bind her arms and take her to the city guard. They thank you for your service, but their words aren’t much counter to the cold, angry stare of the Scoundrel as she’s taken away."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_63_INTRO,"“I assume you are aware of an increased amount of sickness in the city.”<br><br>You were summoned to the Ghost Fortress and now stand before the Captain of the Guard.<br><br>“We believe it could have something to do with a poisoning threat brought to our attention by your Mindthief friend a while ago. We ignored it, but now she is nowhere to be found, the Hook Coast is a bed of disease, and Gloomhaven proper is on its way there, too.”<br><br>He looks at you firmly. “I need you to head down to the Hook Coast and figure out what is going on. Then eliminate the source of the poison."""
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_63_OPTION_A,Agree to help. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_63_OPTION_B,Tell the captain to fix his own problem. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_63_RESULT_A,"The Hook Coast is outside the walls of Gloomhaven and can be a dangerous place. And since this spread of poison, the city has become even more defenseless than normal. You hope you’ll be able to find a solution to the problem quickly."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_63_RESULT_B,"The Captain of the Guard sighs.<br><br>“I really thought you were the ones for the job. What business could you possibly have that is more important than making sure this city is safe?”<br><br>He holds up his hand. “No matter. Fine, just get out of here! We will deal with this ourselves.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_64_INTRO,"Late in the evening, you are returning to your rooms when you hear a cry for help coming from a nearby alleyway. Racing into the shadows, you expect to find someone in distress, but instead find a group of men clad in black leather armor eying you maliciously.<br><br>“We have a message for your Nightshroud friend,” one of them says, drawing a wicked-looking curved blade. Suddenly, the Nightshroud appears among them in a flash of fatal sword strikes. Before the men even have a chance to react, half of them lie dead on the ground. The other half quickly flee.<br><br>“Well, it looks like you’re into it now, too. Which is good, because I need help taking them down.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_64_OPTION_A,Stay and listen to what the Nightshroud has to say.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_64_OPTION_B,Claim you want nothing to do with this and walk away.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_64_RESULT_A,"The Nightshroud kicks one of the corpses. “This is the Sin-Ra Syndicate, a group of assassins trying to gain a foothold in the region. I’m trying to stop them, and somehow they found out you and I were friends. They decided to go after you as retribution. Lucky for you, I’ve located their hideout, so we’re going to sneak in there and end this whole business once and for all.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_64_RESULT_B,"“The Sin-Ra Syndicate seems to think you have something to do with this,” the Nightshroud yells at you as you leave. “That’s all that matters! They’ll strike again, and I won’t be there to protect you!” You keep walking."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_65_INTRO,"In the middle of the night, you are wakened by a hard knocking at your door. You answer, and it takes you a second to recognize the man standing on the other side.<br><br>“Those Oak relics you was lookin’ for,” the man says as he scratches a blister on the side of his face. “Some cutpurses tried to sell them to me. I can take you to their place, but we gotta move fast, and I want a cut of the loot.”<br><br>You hurriedly agree and make your way to a ramshackle warehouse next to the old docks.<br><br>“This is it,” the man says. “Looks like no one’s home, though.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_65_OPTION_A,Raid the warehouse and recover the stolen goods.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_65_OPTION_B,Wait until the thieves return so you can apprehend them.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_65_RESULT_A,"You head into the warehouse and search, eventually finding a hidden cache of stolen goods. The thieves, however, are nowhere to be found. You think about waiting for them to return, but it’s possible they have already been alerted to your presence. You return to the sanctuary, where the priest is pleased to have the artifacts returned, but troubled that the thieves are still out there."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_65_RESULT_B,"You hide behind some barrels and wait for the thieves to return. It takes the rest of the night, but just as you are about to give up, two men approach the door. It’s easy enough to get the drop on them, overpower them, and deliver them to the authorities. When you return the stolen artifacts to the sanctuary, the priest is incredibly pleased with your work."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_66_INTRO,"You head back to your rooms for the night when you see the Sawbones sitting in front of your doorstep, looking rather dejected.<br><br>“I, uh, well, you see...” he stammers, “I followed your advice. Chased my dreams and all that, but I ended up in debt to some rather unscrupulous people. They’ve threatened to kill me if I don’t pay them off, but, uh, but I simply don’t have the money.”<br><br>He hesitates. “Seeing as how, uh, you bear some responsibility for setting me down this path, I was wondering if you’d be willing to offer some assistance in getting me out of this mess?”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_66_OPTION_A,Offer to pay off the Sawbones’ debt.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_66_OPTION_B,Get the Sawbones on a boat across the Misty Sea. New adventures surely await there.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_66_RESULT_A,"It’s a hefty chunk of money, but the Sawbones is incredibly grateful.<br><br>“This is wonderful! I knew I could count on you. This should be enough to put this mess behind me and finally allow me to live free.”<br><br>He hands you a potion and thanks you once again for all your help."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_66_RESULT_B,"You flatly refuse to pay off the Sawbones’ debt and convince him the only way to escape his pursuers is to board a ship bound for the eastern continent, far out of their reach. He is reluctant, but eventually agrees when you remind him what unknown adventures await in the land across the ocean. You see him off in the night and desperately hope that is the last you hear of this situation."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_67_INTRO,"You are trying to enjoy a relaxing drink at the Sleeping Lion when a number of large men and Inox burst into the tavern and approaches your table.<br><br>“So, you must be that little creep’s collateral,” one of the Inox says. “We’re here to collect.”<br><br>When you stare at her in silence, she tries again. “Little grey-bearded man. Wore symbols of the Great Oak. He said you lot would pay off his debt if he couldn’t.”<br><br>She pats an axe at her side. “Now, seeing as how he apparently skipped town, you can pay us, or things are gonna get ugly.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_67_OPTION_A,Pay off the thugs.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_67_OPTION_B,Refuse to pay. You won’t be strongarmed by anyone.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_67_RESULT_A_A,"You sigh and hand over the Sawbones’ debt, plus interest. Though it feels terrible, the thugs are satisfied and walk out the same way they came in. At least it is over now."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_67_RESULT_A_B,"Seeing as how you don’t have enough money, you decide pursue other options."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_67_RESULT_B,"You laugh and wave your hand dismissively. There’s no way you will be paying such a large amount of money to these thugs. Unfortunately, the Inox is not amused.<br><br>“Then your payment will be blood!” she says. “Meet us in the back alley, and we’ll see if we can’t come to terms.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_68_INTRO,"You wake in the middle of the night to the sound of rushing water. In the corner of your room, you see a flood gushing out of the head of the Summoner’s staff, which you had previously picked up in your travels.<br><br>You jump out of bed and splash through a growing puddle of water to investigate the staff, but you can’t make any sense of it. It seems to be materializing the water out of thin air, possibly channeling it from another plane of existence. You scratch your head, unsure of what to do next."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_68_OPTION_A,Find some way to get the water to stop gushing.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_68_OPTION_B,Get the staff out of your room and throw it into the bay.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_68_RESULT_A_A,"You take a moment to attune yourself to the staff, which you feel now has a direct link another plane. The water stops and you are left with an open gateway."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_68_RESULT_A_B,"You figure out how to work the staff, but not before your entire room is flooded. The innkeeper will not be happy."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_68_RESULT_B,"You race out of the inn, trying to minimize the damage caused by the never-ending stream of water. Not knowing what else to do, you head toward the river. Standing on the banks, you shrug and toss the staff into the current. You guess you’ll never know how the staff ended up where it did or why it suddenly turned into a faucet."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_69_INTRO,"You are rather surprised to walk into the Brown Door one night to see your old friend the Soothsinger playing a song on the corner stage. You are even more surprised when you get closer and discover the song is about you.<br><br>It is a raucous tale about the time she met you in a forest and you gave her terrible directions—just the worst, most backward directions possible.<br><br>Everyone in the crowd is tearing up with laughter as she eloquently describes your bumbling and ineptitude."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_69_OPTION_A,Embrace the joke and go with it.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_69_OPTION_B,Leave the bar before someone recognizes you.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_69_RESULT_A,"You make your way to the front of the crowd and join in the fun. When the Soothsinger notices you in the crowd, she brings you up on stage for the chorus. It’s a little embarrassing, but people are enjoying your positive attitude about it."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_69_RESULT_B,"You flee the bar to escape the tune, but it doesn’t prove to be that simple. The next day, everyone on the street is humming the tune. They all seems to be looking at you and laughing. It’s a nightmare."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_6_INTRO,"You awake in the middle of the night to the sound of alarms ringing in the west. You recognize them as the warning clangs of an attack on the wall.<br><br>Any force bold enough to assault the defenses of Gloomhaven can’t be good. For a moment you are grateful for the prolific number of guards defending the city. But still, there is always the possibility that the guards may not be enough."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_6_OPTION_A,Go aid in the defense of the city. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_6_OPTION_B,"If the guards are distracted by an attacking force, now would be the perfect time to steal some valuables."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_6_RESULT_A,"You rush toward the West Gate, eager to fight back the invaders. As you approach, you see a mass of Vermlings climbing over the wall and attacking the guards with daggers and arrows. You yell and charge into the battle. It is a rough fight, but you emerge victorious, covered in fur and blood. The citizens of Gloomhaven remain safe, and the town is free to grow and prosper."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_6_RESULT_B,"The town erupts into chaos with panicked cries of “Vermlings!”—a perfect opportunity to collect some valuables. Slinking around to an abandoned shop, you find a way in and pilfer the safe. In the morning, the devastation from the assault is noticeable. Downtrodden looks greet you as you pass, and you wonder if your presence was missed along the walls."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_70_INTRO,"You are wandering the Sinking Market looking for possible work when you are approached by a dirty-looking boy with a scar on his cheek.<br><br>You greet him warmly. He has given you leads on a number of mercenary jobs and you recently helped him avoid a jail cell.<br><br>“I need some help, and I really don’t know who else to turn to,” he begins. “All of us here in the Sinking Market are in a bad way. Our houses are collapsing, our water is foul, and we don’t even have enough money for food.<br><br>“We are dying here, and the city is doing nothing to help us. You have friends in high places, right? Please, there’s gotta be someone you can talk to.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_70_OPTION_A,Talk to some merchants about revitalizing the area.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_70_OPTION_B,Regretfully explain that you don’t have the power to effect change like this.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_70_RESULT_A_A,"You head to the Coin District and meet with a member of the merchant’s guild you’ve had dealings with before. He looks at you skeptically, but says he will see what he can do about making the area more livable."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_70_RESULT_A_B,Every merchant you try to talk to about the issue laughs you out of the room. Why help others when there is no profit in it for them?
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_70_RESULT_B,"You explain that while you do have some power in the town, the Sinking Market may be a lost cause. More and more of the district is sinking into the sea every day, as it has been doing for as long as the town has existed. You can’t convince merchants to spend money on something that will one day be underwater."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_71_INTRO,"You are walking along the river’s edge in the Mixed District late at night when something in your pack begins to vibrate. The sensation is odd and you quickly fish out the small metal sphere you found out on the road. It shakes uncontrollably and then begins pulling your arm toward the river.<br><br>You walk to the bank, but still the sphere pulls. It is drawn to something in the water."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_71_OPTION_A,Let the sphere go.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_71_OPTION_B,Jump into the river and continue to follow the sphere’s pull.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_71_RESULT_A,"The sphere leaps from your hand, hovers over the water, and then emits an intense beam of light straight down into the river, illuminating something below.<br><br>You shrug and jump into the river, following the beam of light down to the bottom. There you find a wooden chest half buried under the rocks. You bring it back to shore and open it to find a small metal rod covered in strange carvings. When you pick it up, the sphere immediately flies back over to you and attaches itself to the rod’s end."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_71_RESULT_B,"As soon as you jump into the cold, brackish waters, the sphere stops vibrating or pulling. You swim for a while in the direction it was pulling, but eventually you realize you are on a fool’s errand. You emerge from the river wet and miserable with absolutely nothing to show for it."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_72_INTRO,"The metal sphere and rod—you’ve had them in your possession for a while now and occasionally pull them out to mull over the carvings. You’ve brought it to the University, but they can’t make any sense of it either.<br><br>You are fiddling with the device in the Sleeping Lion when you are tapped on the shoulder. You turn to see a wicked grin on the dirty face of a old bandit. “They call me Fish, and that there is a key, friend—a key of the ancient sort.”<br><br>Before you can ask, Fish pulls out a similar black sphere atop a metal rod. “They’re twins, ain’t they, and Fish knows just what they open. A tomb of treasure, friend. Come, come, Fish will show you the way.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_72_OPTION_A,Follow the smelly old bandit.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_72_OPTION_B,Refuse to go with the man. This whole situation seems...fishy.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_72_RESULT_A,"Your curiosity gets the better of your judgment. You need to know the purpose of the device you found, so you follow Fish into a derelict shack where he pulls out a map of the area and lays it on a table. Fish directs you to pull out your rod and both you and he hold your respective rods over the table.<br><br>A specific location on the map glows brightly and Fish laughs. “See? I told ya, didn’t I? Meet me there with your rod and we’ll get rich!”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_72_RESULT_B,This suspicious old man must have seen you in here before with the rod and fashioned some elaborate con to swindle you out of something. You won’t be so easily fooled. There’s no way he knows what the rod does when no one else in town does. You push him away and go back to your drink.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_73_INTRO,"You awake in your bed to sensation of someone shaking you, but when you look around, you see no one else in your room. Instead, you see that it’s the entire room that’s shaking.<br><br>Your thoughts immediately go to the crystal you found inside the mountain along the road. You quickly search through your belongings and grab the crystal in your hand. The earthquake immediately stops.<br><br>Clearly this thing has some power and you need to deal with it before more damage is done."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_73_OPTION_A,Seek help from the University.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_73_OPTION_B,Throw the crystal into the bay. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_73_RESULT_A,"“Yes, very interesting,” a bookish Quatryl says as he rolls the crystal over in his hand. “It seems as if this crystal is attuned to a specific location, and once removed, it begins vibrating until mountains and houses start falling down. I’d say you need to return it to its proper home. With the proper tools—which I’ll need help paying for—I should be able to triangulate that location for you.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_73_RESULT_B,"Not wanting to waste your time with the problem, you walk to the docks and throw the crystal into the bay. When you hear reports of harsher weather and larger waves hitting the docks, you try not to pay them any mind."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_74_INTRO,"“Welcome to the Marvelous and Magic Techno-Circus!” The Quatryl with a top hat you met on the road greets you as you enter the circus tent. “We always welcome our friends to come and see the wondrous sights!”<br><br>You wander around the pavilion for a while, looking at all signs for all manner of improbable creatures. Ultimately you will have to decide on what to see first."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_74_OPTION_A,Go watch the dancing bear.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_74_OPTION_B,Visit the famed fortune-teller.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_74_RESULT_A,"You enter a smaller tent off the main one and come face-to-face with what is indeed a dancing bear. Its handler stands to the side, prodding it on occasion, while the bear stands on its hind two legs and shuffles back and forth. It is amusing until the handler prods the bear one too many times and the bear becomes enraged and attacks. You quickly jump into action and subdue the bear, saving the handler from getting mauled to death."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_74_RESULT_B,"You enter the fortune-teller’s tent and the old Orchid woman’s expression immediately goes dark. She gestures you to sit at her table, and when you do, she grabs your arm and looks deep into your eyes.<br><br>“Your path is dark and cursed. There is a shadow around you—a Gloom. You must leave this place. Be rid of it before it consumes you.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_75_INTRO,"Returning to Gloomhaven after your latest outing, you are approached by the Captain of the Guard at the city gates.<br><br>“Ah, I was hoping I might catch you here sooner or later,” he says. “I have still been receiving reports about large, flying lizards from the scouts. Tell me, have you gotten to the bottom of that situation yet?”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_75_OPTION_A,Lie and say that you are still working on it.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_75_OPTION_B,Tell the Captain you decided not to kill the Elder Drake.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_75_RESULT_A,"“Oh, hmm...well, that’s disappointing.” The Captain looks at you with dejected frustration. “If you could, please look into the sightings as soon as you can. I’d hate to think of some giant flying creature attacking the city.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_75_RESULT_B,"“Oh, my...well, okay.” The Captain looks at you with stunned curiosity. “So there is a massive, fire-breathing drake up in the mountains, and you decided there was no reason to kill it? Interesting.”<br><br>The Captain wanders off, mumbling about needing to find better help."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_76_INTRO,"You are walking through the new docks when a well-dressed merchant flags you down.<br><br>“Oh, my, what a fortuitous encounter,” he whispers as you approach. “May I buy you a drink? I have a very sensitive job for you, and I’d like to avoid the prying eyes around us.”<br><br>The merchant, an iron dealer named Gavin, makes a gesture toward a large group of dock workers. “I can’t trust anyone. Well, anyone except you of course.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_76_OPTION_A,Accept the drink. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_76_OPTION_B,Decline the suspicious offer and continue your business.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_76_RESULT_A_A,"“Excellent! Someone has been attacking my ships at sea and I need to get to the bottom of it. Come, I’ll tell you the details.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_76_RESULT_A_B,"“Oh, whoops,” Gavin stammers. “From far away, you looked like someone else. Just ignore what I said.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_76_RESULT_B,Gavin looks flabbergasted as you walk away. “Who will protect my ships when there is no one to trust? I guess I’ll just have to keep looking.”
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_77_INTRO,"“Well, well, well. If it isn’t the most notorious band of mercenaries in all of Gloomhaven. The guards looking to throw you in the Ghost Fortress yet, or are they on the payroll?”<br><br>You turn around to see Red Nick, a well-known fence, leaning up against the wall. You’ve had certain dealings with him in the past.<br><br>“Fancy seeing you, actually,” he says. “I’ve got a big job, and I figure if anyone wouldn’t mind digging up graves, it would be you miscreants.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_77_OPTION_A,Do the job.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_77_OPTION_B,Claim you’ve changed your ways and grave robbing is a step too far.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_77_RESULT_A_A,"“That’s the money-loving criminals I know and love! Come take a walk with me, and I’ll explain how we can all get rich.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_77_RESULT_A_B,"“Oh, whoops,” Nick stammers. “From the back you looked like...uh, never mind. Forget I said anything.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_77_RESULT_B,"“A downright shame, I say.” Nick shakes his head. “I guess I’ll just have to find a group of mercenaries who actually are interested in making a mountain of money.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_78_INTRO,"The scene is typical. A nervous-looking man stands in front of your table at the Sleeping Lion. You eye him lazily until he speaks.<br><br>“I was, um, told you might be able to help me,” he starts. “I was in the Corpsewood conducting some, uh, business, when my partners and I were attacked by Vermlings. I barely escaped with my life, but my partners weren’t so lucky.<br><br>“One of them was carrying something valuable—an artifact we managed to find in our, uh, business. It’s very important I get it back. I followed the Vermlings back to their nest, and I can assure you they have many valuables. I’ll show you where it is, and you can take whatever you want. Just bring me back the artifact.”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_78_OPTION_A,Accept the man's deal.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_78_OPTION_B,Demand payment for the job up-front.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_78_RESULT_A,"The sweaty man is all too eager to give you the details of where to find this nest.<br><br>“Once you clear the Vermlings and find the artifact, you should be able to locate a large stash of valuables in a pit back behind the main camp. Take whatever you want, just return the artifact to me.”<br><br>You smile and nod. After taking the valuables, you should be able to squeeze quite a bit extra out of this fellow as well when you return."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_78_RESULT_B,"“Look...I, ah, don’t have a whole lot of capital right now, but I will give you everything I have once you get back with that artifact.”<br><br>You narrow your eyes at him. He coughs nervously and produces a small handful of coins.<br><br>“All right, fine. Look, here. This is all I can offer you. Now can we get to the part where you go do your job?”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_79_INTRO,The sun is out and you are enjoying a pleasant stroll across the Silent Bridge until you see two demons attacking a man ahead of you.<br><br>You get closer and can hear the demons berating the man as they swipe at him with their claws.<br><br>“You dare spit on us as we walk past?” One of them yells. “We will show you the consequences of defying authority!”
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_79_OPTION_A,Intervene on the man's behalf.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_79_OPTION_B,Keep walking. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_79_RESULT_A,There is only one method these demons respect: violence. You run forward and hack at one of the demons’ arms as it comes down to strike at the man. The arm falls limp to the ground and the rest of the demon soon follows.<br><br>The other demon looks at you with seething rage as you face it with raised weapons. “This grave insult will not go unpunished! This city will feel our wrath!”
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_79_RESULT_B,"You continue your stroll, trying to block the unpleasantness from your mind. Unfortunately, others around you cannot, and they are reminded of the actions you took that caused this horrible and all-too-frequent occurrence."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_7_INTRO,Occasionally your dealings in town lead you past the bustling docks. All conversation gets drowned out by the constant din of loading and unloading cargo and crew. This makes it all the more surprising when you hear a voice above the noise directed straight at you.<br><br>“Oi! You with the hard looks and big arms! I desperately need some help o’er here! Spare a few minutes to help make sure I get out of port on time? Otherwise I’ll be stuck here until tomorrow!”
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_7_OPTION_A,Help the captain load his ship.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_7_OPTION_B,Move on with your business. You don't have the time or inclination for such things. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_7_RESULT_A,"What was advertised as a few minutes turns out to be an hour or two as you lug large crates full of some foul-smelling liquid from a nearby warehouse into the hold of the ship. At least the captain is relieved that he’ll be able to set sail on time, though. He gratefully pays you, but you can’t help but think that such menial labor might be beneath you."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_7_RESULT_B,"Unwilling to be bothered by such trivial matters, you continue on your way amidst curses from the ship’s captain. “Blast it all! You’ll get nowhere in life with that sort of attitude!”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_80_INTRO,"As you prepare to leave the city on another journey, you are suddenly surrounded by a large group of guards near the west gate.<br><br>“We hear you’ve been spreading rumors,” one of them says. “Claiming that the guards are causing the Vermling attacks on the city. That’s some high-grade garbage you’re spewing.”<br><br>“My best friend died in the last Vermling raid!” another one yells. “You got something smart to say about that?”"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_80_OPTION_A,Attempt to calm down the guards and explain the situation.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_80_OPTION_B,These guards are not interested in a friendly discourse. Prepare to defend yourself.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_80_RESULT_A_A,"You adopt a serious tone and do your best to communicate that you had nothing to do with what was written in the Town Records. You express remorse for their hardships, and, miraculously, the mob grows calmer and disperses."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_80_RESULT_A_B,"You laugh and claim that this is all some big misunderstanding. The guards don’t see it that way, but your lack of aggression at least stops them from attacking you. They leave, grumbling threats."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_80_RESULT_B,"Seeing the situation turning south, you waste no time pulling your weapons and prepare for an attack. The guards are more than happy to oblige.<br><br>Luckily your foes sustain only some minor injuries in the time it takes for another squad of guards to arrive and break up the scuffle. They let you go on your way, but you can see the disdain in all of their eyes."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_81_INTRO,"“Hey, aren’t you the mercenaries who stopped that weird tornado from destroying the city?”<br><br>You turn to see a dirty dock worker pointing at you with wonder in his eyes. “What was that all about anyway?”<br><br>More people stop and stare at you. This has become an unfortunately common occurrence since the Gloom was destroyed. You have become something of a minor celebrity in Gloomhaven."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_81_OPTION_A,Take the time to relate the story of what happened. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_81_OPTION_B,Claim it wasn't you and leave quickly. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_81_RESULT_A,"You smile and nod, explaining how an ancient force attempted to destroy the city, but it was banished to another plane. Everyone around you stands enraptured by your story and cheers and claps at its conclusion.<br><br>After a few additional questions, you are finally able extricate yourself from the crowd and continue your business."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_81_RESULT_B,"You brusquely shake your head and wave your hand away, saying the man has the wrong person. His excited face immediately turns to one of disappointment. And audible sigh of dejection emerges from the crowd as you rush away.<br><br>“There’s no need to be rude about it!” the dockworker yells at your back."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_82_INTRO,"In a rare moment of peace and quiet you find yourselves looking out over the dockside and spend a few minutes discussing how the last mission went down. <br><br>""Mercenaries eh?"" says a voice from behind you. You turn and see a young street urchin, ""I'm sure you think you are pretty tough, but are you brave enough for a real challenge?"""
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_82_OPTION_A,"Wave the child away, they clearly have nothing of interest for professionals like you."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_82_OPTION_B,A challenge? Count us in!
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_82_RESULT_A,"""Well, next time then.  Maybe this will help change your mind.""<br><br>They flip a single gold piece... You laugh as they run off into the crowds.<br>"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_82_RESULT_B,"""I knew it!"", they giggle excitedly and pass you a note.<br><br>You open it, on it are scrawled a few words:<br><br>“Are you brave enough to face the swarm?"" and a crude drawing of a building that looks a lot like the Sleeping Lion.<br><br>When you look up, the child has gone."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_8_INTRO,"On a trip to the New Market, you see a curious sea chart prominently displayed in a Valrath merchant’s stall.<br><br>“Ah, I see this interests you!” he says while holding it up, taking great care not to damage it. “I’ve been told this map will lead you to a location of untold riches! Wondrous beyond anything you have seen before!”<br><br>The Valrath gestures grandly with his free hand and his smile grows wide. “How can you say no to this? Just make me an offer."""
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_8_OPTION_A,The map does look valuable. Decide to bargain for it. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_8_OPTION_B,Refuse to deal with the merchant. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_8_RESULT_A_A,"After some amount of haggling back and forth, you settle on a price and pay for the map. You recognize some of the landmarks and should be able to find this place of “untold treasure” by hiring a ship."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_8_RESULT_A_B,"Despite your valiant efforts, you cannot get the merchant to lower his price to something you can afford."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_8_RESULT_B,"Wary of the merchant’s overly exuberant nature, you politely decline his offer and go about your intended business."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_9_INTRO,"After a night of heavy drinking, you get turned around while navigating the back alleys and find yourself standing before a collapsed section of bricked road that leads down into an underground tunnel.<br><br>Fueled by curiosity and a bit of liquid courage, you descend in search of adventure. Stumbling around in the vast network of tunnels proves rather fruitless, however, until a well-concealed passage leads you to a long-forgotten stash of weaponry and dried food.<br><br>The stuff could fetch a decent price at the Sunken Market, or you could turn it over to the city guard, which is always in need of arms and rations."
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_9_OPTION_A,Sell the goods.
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_9_OPTION_B,Donate the goods to the city. 
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_9_RESULT_A,"Using a few less-than-savory contacts, you’re able to unload the goods for a respectable price. Who knew drunken strolls could prove so profitable?"
EVENT_CITY_CAMPAIGN_9_RESULT_B,"You sleep off the previous night’s revelries and approach the Captain of the Guard. “This is wonderful news! With attacks on the city becoming ever more frequent, our blacksmiths are having trouble keeping up with our demands. And the food should help considerably if we ever find ourselves under siege. This is truly a big help to the city.”"
EVENT_Duel,"You hear the clashes and clangs of what sounds like a fight taking place up ahead. As you draw near, you see a Savvas and an Inox locked in a fierce duel.<br><br>They both notice your arrival and call to you for aid."

EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_10_INTRO,"You have only just wandered off the main road in search of your destination when the ground begins to shift beneath your feet. <br><br>What was once solid now gives way, and you find yourself falling down into a dark pit. You land twenty feet down, cushioned by the soil that fell with you. <br><br>You stand up with alertness and look around, trying to get your bearings. You have fallen into a man-made cavern with some smooth stone walls and floors. <br><br>This could be a trap or just some long-forgotten structure. "

In one, you find a pedestal and, sitting atop that, a small, metal sphere. <br><br>You take the strange sphere and continue your search, but the only other remarkable thing you find is an exit. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_11_INTRO,"You are headed through a mountainous region when the ground begins to shift and shake beneath you. Taken off your guard, you fall to your knees. <br><br>The tremors continue unabated and grow stronger. You hear rumbling as rocks begin to tumble down the mountainside."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_11_OPTION_A,Try to find a clearing where you can avoid the falling rocks.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_11_OPTION_B,Take cover under a nearby outcropping and wait out the earthquake. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_11_RESULT_A,"You race forward, scanning the area for an open space where the danger from rock slides will be less severe. After dodging some rocks and getting hit by others, you find a relatively safe area and wait for the chaos to subside. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_11_RESULT_B_A,"You jump under an outcropping, but something is not right. Those among you tuned to the elements turn toward the face of the mountain and step into it, as though the rocks were gone, Inside, you see an odd crystal jutting out of the earth. You snatch it up, and the tremors stop. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_11_RESULT_B_B,The outcropping proves to be an unstable place to hide. You are quickly buried in rubble. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_12_INTRO,"A rustling in a nearby thicket stops you in your tracks. You crouch down and assume a defensive stance. <br><br>Suddenly, a tiny ball of fur with short, stubby legs leaps out at you, It barks at you twice in a ineffectual, high-pitched tone and then begins to wag its tail. <br><br>You relax your weapons. What is such a small, defenceless puppy doing out in the wilderness?"
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_12_OPTION_A,Leave the puppy to fend for itself.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_12_OPTION_B,Take the puppy and bring it back to Gloomhaven.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_12_RESULT_A,"Adorable as the puppy is, you are not the ones to care for it. You are headed into danger, and you can't let anything distract you from the task at hand. It follows you for a while, barking in indignation, but it eventually wanders off. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_12_RESULT_B,"You sigh and lift the puppy into your arms. It barks happily and licks your face. This will surely prove a distraction in your upcoming battle, but once you get back to Gloomhaven, you should be able to find it a nice home. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_13_INTRO,"Traveling off the beaten path, you are surprised to see a large group of figures on the horizon. You take out your weapons and move cautiously forward. <br><br>As you get closer, it becomes clear that the figures are not alive, but sculptures of some kind, made haphazardly out of branches, garbage, and scrap metal. There are fifty or so in the middle of a field, with no other signs of life as far as you can see. <br><br>You see a necklace that may be valuable on one of them and go to grab it.<br><br>""Don't touch her!"" You wheel around to see an old man in rags emerge from a hole in the ground and charge at you with a broken broom handle. ""These women are all mine!"""
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_13_OPTION_A,Defend yourself with lethal force.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_13_OPTION_B,Attempt to calm down the hermit and resolve the situation peacefully. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_13_RESULT_A,"With a single swing of your sword, the old man's head separates from his body and tumbles to the ground. The stench coming from his rags is terrible, so you grab what valuables you can find and quickly move on. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_13_RESULT_B,"You grab the broom handle and wrestle the old man to the ground, attempting to restrain his flailing limbs. You try to explain that this is all a misunderstanding, but he just keeps warning you not to defecate on his wives. The man is surprisingly agile, and the stench of his rags also makes keeping him pinned difficult. He slips free and scrambles around for his broom handle, muttering about the ""stars' gift."" You run away with haste, but his odor is much harder to escape. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_14_INTRO,"You are walking down the road when the sound of many wings pulls your gaze to the sky. Above you, you see a large flock of white birds flying southward. <br><br>At that height, you figure a well-aimed arrow could bring one of them down to make a nice meal. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_14_OPTION_A,Shoot at the birds. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_14_OPTION_B,Let the birds pass undisturbed. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_14_RESULT_A,"You pull back your bow and take aim. The arrow flies true and connects with one of the birds. You retrieve it, pluck it, cook it, and eat it. Definitely beats the field rations you carry with you. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_14_RESULT_B,"The shot would be difficult, and you'd prefer not to waste the arrow. You simply move on toward your destination.  "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_15_INTRO,"You are walking down the road when the sound of many wings pulls your gaze to the sky. Above you, you see a large flock of red birds flying southward. <br><br>At that height, you figure a well-aimed arrow could bring one of them down to make a nice meal. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_15_OPTION_A,Shoot at the birds. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_15_OPTION_B,Let the birds pass undisturbed. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_15_RESULT_A,"You pull back your bow and take aim. The instant you loose the arrow, however, you notice something odd about the birds. They are much farther away than you realised, and much bigger. The arrow misses, but it gets their attention. As the flock turns and descends toward you, you realize you just shot at a group of drakes. You run for cover among the trees, but are hit by their acidic spit a number of times in the process.  "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_15_RESULT_B,"The shot would be difficult, and you'd prefer not to waste the arrow. You simply move on toward your destination.  "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_16_INTRO,"The route to your destination is less direct than you had hoped, and you end up taking a shortcut through a small forest. <br><br>There you happen upon a family of deer. They are still a ways off in the distance and haven't noticed you. <br><br>You approach cautiously. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_16_OPTION_A,Shoot at one of the deer. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_16_OPTION_B,Just watch the deer for a little bit. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_16_RESULT_A,"You notch your bow and take a few steps forward to find a better shooting position. Unfortunately, the deer notice your presence and bound off. You shoot a few arrows as they go, but nothing connects. <br><br>Then an arrow flies out of the brush and into your shoulder. ""Foul city-dwellers!"" a voice cries out from the trees. ""I had been stalking that herd for hours and you spooked them!"" More arrows rain down as you run away. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_16_RESULT_B,"You are enjoying watching the animals graze when an arrow flies out and hits the larger of the deer in its center chest. It bolts away, but doesn't make it very far before collapsing.<br><br>Then you see a large Inox emerge from the brush and turn toward you. ""I thought you were going to do something stupid there for a second. Thanks for not scaring away my quarry. Allow me to share some of the spoils with you."" "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_17_INTRO,"Not far outside Gloomhaven, you look up to see a large bird flying overhead. Something is odd, though. Its movements are jerky, and there is smoke billowing out of it. Then you see it plunge into a sudden nose-dive and crash to the ground off in the east. <br><br>You rush to the scene and find a limping, soot-covered Quatryl kicking a giant winged contraption made of leather and metal.<br><br>""Curse this wretched thing!"" He yells in frustration. ""I thought I'd worked it out, and then I suddenly lost pressure in the piston chamber!""<br><br>He looks over at you. ""You there! Wonderful timing!"" Help me get this thing back into the air. There is no time to waste!"""
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_17_OPTION_A,Do whatever the Quatryl says. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_17_OPTION_B,Demand an explanation before you help in any way. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_17_RESULT_A,"You set the wings and bang out a few dents while the Quatryl repairs his pressure problem. In under an hour, the Quatryl declares the contraption airworthy and jumps in the cockpit. You stand clear and watch in awe as the thing begins flapping wildly, then sputters forward and lifts off the ground. <br><br>Unfortunately, the flight is short-lived, and the second crash is not nearly as forgiving. You find the Quatryl dead on impact, and there's nothing more to do except harvest the machine for valuable parts. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_17_RESULT_B,"You force the Quatryl to slow down and talk to you, but his eyes keep darting around in a panic. ""Don't you understand? The world needs my technology now! I must perfect it! It will revolutionize everything!""<br><br>You agree that the power of flight is pretty great, but you convince the Quatryl that the world can wait a day for him to get some rest and organize his thoughts. You help him transport the broken machine back to town. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_18_INTRO,"The road contains many dangers, the chief among them are the barbaric tribes of Inox that inhabit the wilderness around the city. This is why your heart sinks when you see a mounted group of them ride up to you and surround your party. <br><br>""Ah, agents of that wretched monstrosity you call a town,"" the largest of the Inox says as he looks down at you. ""Tell me, scum. What business do you have out here on my land? Have those fools sent you out to murder more of my people?""  "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_18_OPTION_A,Attempt to come to a peaceful resolution.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_18_OPTION_B,"Attack the insulting, contemptuous Inox. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_18_RESULT_A_A,"You begin to agree with the Inox that Gloomhaven is a blight on the land in need of cleansing, and the Inox seems to believe you. ""Go in peace, then,"" the leader says. ""And stay off my land."""
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_18_RESULT_A_B,"You try to explain that you mean the Inox no ill will, but the leader eyes you skeptically. ""Foul creature. I curse you and your kind! Run—get off my land and never come back!"""
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_18_RESULT_B,"Enraged by the Inox's insulting tongue, you take up your weapons and attack. Even the Inox were not expecting a move so bold. The fight is brutal, especially with your enemy mounted, but after felling a number of their warriors, the rest retreat. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_19_INTRO,"Heading down the main road, you see an odd-looking wagon in front of you. It is covered in metal bars and a number of ragged men in chains walk behind it. On either side of the wagon, you see city guards on horseback keeping a watchful eye on everything. <br><br>You get closer and one of the guards calls out to you. ""Keep your distance! We are transporting dangerous criminals.""<br><br>A moment later, one of the prisoners in back slips out of his manacles and begins to sprint full speed into the tall grass. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_19_OPTION_A,Help the guards catch their escaping man.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_19_OPTION_B,Interfere with the guards to help the man escape. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_19_RESULT_A_A,"You chase after the sprinting man, but the guards conclude you must be an accomplice trying to help him. They shoot arrows in your direction, forcing you to retreat from the situation. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_19_RESULT_A_B,"The man's speed after spending months in jail is no match for your own. With the help of the guards on horseback, you quickly have him cornered and returned to the wagon."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_19_RESULT_B,"Criminals deserve freedom as much as the next man. While the guards are distracted by the one escapee, you rush to the wagon and release the others. Chaos erupts as the prisoners scatter in every direction. Many manage to escape, and you find a mysterious gift of thanks waiting on your doorstep when you return to Gloomhaven. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_1_INTRO,"""Heading out a little late, aren't you?"" The guard at the wall looks at you passively. You grunt in response and head through the opened gate.<br><br>""Nobody's gonna go looking for your corpse if you don't return!"" the guard shouts at your back.<br><br>You end up embarking out on the road much later than you had hoped—events in town saw to that—but as the dusk settles on the horizon you feel confident that you are up to any threat you might face.<br><br>And then begins the howling of wolves—vicious, foul beasts—and, judging from their sounds, they seem to be getting closer."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_1_OPTION_A,Run from the howling to safety. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_1_OPTION_B,Let the wolves come. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_1_RESULT_A,"You pick up and run as fast as you can through the underbrush and away from the ominous sounds. They seem to be receding as you stumble headlong into some sort of thicket filled with sticky spines. <br><br>You pull yourself out, but not before your skin is pierced in numerous places and becomes inflamed. Best to avoid this plant in the future."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_1_RESULT_B,"Confident that the wolves pose no significant threat, you stand your ground and prepare for battle. The pack comes—ragged and hungry, slowly emerging from the dark— and surrounds your party. <br><br>There are more of them than you expected, but not enough to take you down. You suffer a bite or two, but are able to fight them off. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_20_INTRO,"You are trudging through some foothills when you hear the strangest sound in the distance. It sounds vaguely like wolves howling, but higher pitched, and there is a rhythm and a melody to it.<br><br>You crest a nearby hill and survey the area, spying a pack of Vermlings standing in a circle and singing. “Singing” is the best way you can think to describe it, anyway. Occasionally during the song they also clap and dance around."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_20_OPTION_A,The song must serve some nefarious purpose. Attack the Vermlings. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_20_OPTION_B,Move closer and enjoy the music. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_20_RESULT_A,"You take the pack by surprise. Fully distracted by their ritual, they don't even see you coming. The Vermlings still get in a few good attacks before they are slain, though. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_20_RESULT_B,"Not wanting to disturb the ritual, you inch a little closer, staying out of sight, and then sit and listen. They go through a number of different tunes, and you feel enriched by the experience. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_21_INTRO,"You find yourself cutting through the dense underbrush of a forest when you notice a number of small woodland animals running along the forest floor in the opposite direction.<br><br>Mice, squirrels, ferrets—they all appear to be running from something up ahead of you. You are filled with a troubling sense of foreboding as you catch a whiff of smoke in the air."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_21_OPTION_A,Keep moving forward. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_21_OPTION_B,Follow the animal's cue and run in the opposite direction. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_21_RESULT_A,"By the time you see the flames, it is too late. A great forest fire is raging around you. You try to run, but you don’t make it out of the blaze without serious injuries and smoke<br>inhalation."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_21_RESULT_B,"Fearing the worst, you turn around and head out of the forest the way you came in. You reach a clearing just before a great fire consumes everything with its blaze. It takes a while to orient yourself and find the road again, but considering the alternative, you feel lucky."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_22_INTRO,"There was a heavy rain last night, and the roads are now dark streaks of mud. And as bad as it is for you walking, you see that others up ahead on the road are having worse trouble. You come upon a collection of wagons stuck in the mud on the side of the road.<br><br>You look around and see an odd assortment of people dressed in garish clothing. They are working to push their brightly painted wagons, all emblazoned with a “Marvelous and Magical Techno-Circus” logo, out of the muck.<br><br>“We just stopped for a quick meal, and now the wheels have sunk into this mess,” a Quatryl with a fancy top hat says as you approach. “I’m sure our strongmen will get us out eventually, but we certainly wouldn’t begrudge a little extra help.”"
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_22_OPTION_A,Help push out the Quatryl ringmaster's wagon.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_22_OPTION_B,Help push out the fortune-teller's wagon.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_22_RESULT_A,"You put down some boards and then heave and push until the great wagon is out of the ditch and moving back on the road. The diminutive Quatryl tips his hat.<br><br>“Well, I certainly could not have done that on my own. Your assistance is greatly appreciated. I tell you what—the next time we’re back in Gloomhaven, why don’t you stop by our circus, and we’ll let you in for free.”"
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_22_RESULT_B,"You take pity on an old Orchid woman trying to extricate her fortune-teller’s wagon by herself. You help her get it back on the road, and then she grabs you and looks deep into your eyes.<br><br>“Your path is dark and cursed. There is a shadow around you—a Gloom. You must leave this place. Be rid of it before it consumes you.”"
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_23_INTRO,"A knapsack and a walking stick on the side of the road catch your attention as you pass. You look around and see a man squatting in the bushes a small distance away.<br><br>“Oh, hello!” he says. “Good timing, actually. You wouldn’t mind grabbing me some leaves, would you? It’s seems I’ve made quite a mess over here.”"
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_23_OPTION_A,Bring the man some leaves. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_23_OPTION_B,Grab his stuff and run off while he's indisposed. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_23_RESULT_A,"You gather up a handful of leaves and walk over to him. If you weren’t quite sure what was going on before, the smell definitely confirms it.<br><br>“Thanks a lot!” he says cheerily. “Sometimes nature calls, am I right?”<br><br>You cough in affirmation and quickly move on."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_23_RESULT_B,You look from the squatting man down to his bag. Surely he has something of value in there. You quickly grab it and run off down the road.<br><br>“Hey!” the man yells at you. “What are you doing? My stuff!”<br><br>You don’t look back.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_24_INTRO,"You come across a group of brow-beaten Inox trudging down the path in the opposite direction as you. Some are pulling carts laden with various miscellany, mostly furs and crudely crafted goods. The rest have armloads of much of the same.<br><br>It is obvious that this is everything the Inox have—their life’s worth in their arms and wagons. They are all covered in what appears to be soot. <br><br>The shaman at the head of the group calls to you. “The beast awakens! The mountain is aflame! Beware you do not anger it!”<br><br>Looking to the horizon, you can see black smoke rising from a far-off peak."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_24_OPTION_A,Aid the Inox with what they are carrying. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_24_OPTION_B,Ignore the Shaman's ramblings. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_24_RESULT_A,"You take pity on the disheveled group of Inox, forced from their home by a natural disaster. You travel with them for a time, treating their wounds and helping to lighten their loads.<br><br>The Shaman thanks you and hands you an amulet. “We can’t return to our homes until the Beast rests. I fear what this may mean for us all. I hope this keeps you safe.”"
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_24_RESULT_B,"You brush off the plight of the Inox tribe, but as you continue to your destination, you begin to feel a certain amount of unease. There is a slight tremble in the soles of your feet, and, in the distance, the black cloud of smoke grows."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_25_INTRO,"You are far off the main road when you see a small band of Inox approaching from the west. You try to divert your path to go around them, but they are moving directly into your path.<br><br>In a few minutes’ time, they overtake you.<br><br>“You’ve wandered into our territory, travelers,” the biggest one says. “We don’t much like visitors.”<br><br>You stare at her blankly.<br><br>“Such acts can be forgiven, but it will cost you.”"
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_25_OPTION_A,Try to reason with the Inox. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_25_OPTION_B,Fight off the Inox. They'll get no payments from you. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_25_RESULT_A_A,"The Inox in your party talks with the leader for a while and they are able to come to an agreement. They punch each other’s chests, and the group lets you through."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_25_RESULT_A_B,"The Inox don’t seem to be budging on this payment issue, so you are forced to pass along a handful of coins. The big one smiles and lets you continue on your way."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_25_RESULT_B,"You raise your weapons and state that no payments will be made this day. The group of Inox snarls and attacks. After you land a few solid blows, though, they break off and run away back to the west, leaving you to tend to your wounds."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_26_INTRO,"You see a lone wagon off to the side of the road up ahead. You approach cautiously.<br><br>As you near, a jovial man with a wide hat waves at you. “Ho there! I don’t suppose you have any expertise in fixing a broken axle? The road wasn’t even that bumpy, and then BAM!” The man claps his hands together.<br><br>“Just splits in half. I need to have all these goods up north in two days, and I am just at a loss about how to get myself out of this pickle!”"
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_26_OPTION_A,Attempt to help the man with his axle problem.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_26_OPTION_B,Tie up the man and take all of the goods he is so concerned about. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_26_RESULT_A_A,"The man talks the whole way through the process, but after an hour or so, the axle is repaired and the man leaves in a radiant mood, bestowing blessings upon you."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_26_RESULT_A_B,"You happily agree to help the man, but quickly realize you don’t know what you are doing. The man thanks you anyway, and you move on."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_26_RESULT_B,"You smile widely and approach the man. He doesn’t even put up a fight. The first thing you do is gag him, because he is a talker. You select the lightest of the valuables to take with you and leave the man tied up on the side of the road. You could say his day just went from bad to worse, but that’s not your problem."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_27_INTRO,"Walking a path between a small grove and a steep cliff, you suddenly find yourself facing a massive group of felled trees blocking the road.<br><br>The placement of the trees seems odd, and you have a wary, suspicious feeling about the whole situation."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_27_OPTION_A,Clear the trees from the road. It is the best way through and will help other travelers. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_27_OPTION_B,Take the time to find a way around the trees. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_27_RESULT_A_A,"The trees are too massive and dense to remove through conventional means, but with elemental power, they are destroyed and swept aside in no time."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_27_RESULT_A_B,"The trees aren’t part of an ambush, but that doesn’t make them any easier to clear. It’s grueling work and by the time you arrive at your destination, you are exhausted."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_27_RESULT_B,"You head into the underbrush of the grove to get around the felled trees, but it is rough going. The growth is very dense and there are quite a few prickly thorns to contend with."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_28_INTRO,"As you walk down a dirt path, you see a hard-looking mercenary sitting in a patch of grass. He nods as you pass.<br><br>“Hey, friends,” he says. There is something off about his tone, though.<br><br>“I don’t suppose one of you might be willing to part with a stamina potion, would you? I’m headed toward Gloomhaven, but I’ve just come such a long way, and I’m not feeling too good about the stretch I have left.”<br><br>With the clank of his sword sheath against his armor and a loud groan, the man stands up. “I’ll pay you well for it.”"
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_28_OPTION_A,Sell the man a stamina potion. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_28_OPTION_A_UNAVAILABLE,Requires: 1 Minor Stamina Potion
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_28_OPTION_B,Politely decline and move quickly on your way. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_28_RESULT_A,"After some oddly tense negotiations, you are able to agree upon a price. With one hand firmly on his sword hilt, the man grabs a coin pouch with the other hand and extends it toward you. You exchange goods and continue on your journey without further incident."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_28_RESULT_B,There was something off-putting about that man. You are more than happy to move along and put some distance between you.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_29_INTRO,"Walking among some foothills, you enter a narrow valley and find a large pile of stones blocking your way. Clearly a rock slide occurred here recently.<br><br>You move closer to the pile and despair at just how large the stones are. Only someone of great strength and skill could clear a path efficiently."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_29_OPTION_A,Attempt to clear the stones from the path. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_29_OPTION_B,Backtrack and find a way around the stone-filled valley. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_29_RESULT_A_A,"The Cragheart’s combination of raw strength and an affinity for stonework is perfect for this task. In a matter of minutes, enough stones have been destroyed or thrown aside to open a path."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_29_RESULT_A_B,"The situation is not ideal, but you work through the pain. By the time a path has been cleared away, you never want to see another rock in your life."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_29_RESULT_B,"You sigh and turn around. After some backward progress, you find another path through the foothills and work your way through it. Unfortunately, it leads you directly into a den of wolves, and they don’t seem too happy about your sudden arrival. You fend them off, but they leave you wounded."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_2_INTRO,"You are feeling a tad hungry as you walk down the road. You are considering stopping for a meal when you come across a thicket of bushes covered in green berries. <br><br>The berries look delicious, but you hesitate. They could be poisonous. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_2_OPTION_A,Eat the berries. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_2_OPTION_B,Pass by the berries and just eat your normal rations. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_2_RESULT_A,You shrug and grab a handful of berries to stuff in your mouth. They are incredibly sweet and just the right amount of tart. You couldn't feel better about your decision. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_2_RESULT_B,"Not wanting to regret making a stupid decision, you refrain from eating the berries and continue on down the road. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_30_INTRO,"You see smoke on the horizon and catch the vague stench of burning flesh. You hasten your step to see what catastrophe lies ahead of you on the road.<br><br>After a few minutes, you come upon a trade caravan, ravaged by a pack of Vermlings, if the tracks in the mud are any indication.<br><br>Dead bodies and broken, upturned carts lie across the path, but you can also see a few survivors, wounded and bloody, on the ground. A woman limps across the road, carrying pieces of wreckage."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_30_OPTION_A,Help the survivors deal with the carnage. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_30_OPTION_B,Finish the job the Vermlings started and loot whatever is left. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_30_RESULT_A_A,"You approach to help those still alive, but the woman in the road screams, gesturing at the Vermling in your group. You try to calm her, but it is of no use. You abandon the cause."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_30_RESULT_A_B,"You disperse through the scene, tending to people’s wounds and getting them back on their feet. It takes a few supplies, but they seem grateful in the end."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_30_RESULT_B,"It takes very little effort to finish off those who survived and put them out of their misery. Unfortunately, the Vermlings were quite thorough in their raid. You only manage to find a handful of goods, with the rest presumably either taken or burned."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_31_INTRO,"You approach the crest of a hill to the sound of yelling and swords clashing. Advancing, you see a trade caravan fighting off a swarm of Vermlings.<br><br>You can easily see that the caravan guards are not doing well. They are vastly outnumbered and forced to remain in a defensive position to protect their employers. You expect they will be overwhelmed and killed in a manner of minutes."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_31_OPTION_A,Charge into the fray to protect the caravan from a savage attack.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_31_OPTION_B,Watch for a while and wait for an opportune moment to strike. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_31_RESULT_A_A,"Fortunately, some of your group excels when in a defensive position, and the tide of the battle clearly turns once they take command of the situation. The Vermlings are driven off and the caravan is saved."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_31_RESULT_A_B,"You try to save the guards, but end up in their same predicament. You manage to fight off the Vermlings, but not before all the guards and merchants are killed."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_31_RESULT_B,"You wait for a good long while, until after the guards have all been slaughtered and the Vermlings are softened up a bit. They’re going through the goods in the wagons when you hit them with a surprise attack. Caught off guard, they go down without much of a fight."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_32_INTRO,"You encounter two Valraths with a small horse and cart on the side of the road. They seem a little uncomfortable at your approach, their hands instinctively going for their weapons.<br><br>You make a sign of peace and they relax a little.<br><br>“Perhaps it is good that you happen by, travelers,” the one on the left says. “Our horse is completely spent and we fare little better. We are in desperate need of some supplies to finish our journey.”<br><br>The Valrath offers a crude smile. “Do you think you could help us in this matter?”"
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_32_OPTION_A,Give the Valraths a portion of your supplies.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_32_OPTION_B,You spent good money on these supplies. Refuse to help. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_32_RESULT_A_A,The Quartermaster steps forward with a smile and hands over a sack of food and gear. He is always well-stocked and the Valraths are grateful for the aid.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_32_RESULT_A_B,"You’ll need to replace the supplies the next time you’re in town, but you decide you can spare them. The Valraths thank you with relief."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_32_RESULT_B,"You apologize curtly and continue on your way. The Valraths seem disappointed, but vaguely understanding. It doesn’t stop them from whispering things about you to each other as you walk away."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_33_INTRO,"Something is...off.<br><br>You stop in the middle of the road and feel a rippling in your skin. You’re not sure what it is, but some strange forces are at work.<br><br>There is a faint whisper on the wind, and you feel as though at any moment, one step could send you plummeting off the face of the earth."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_33_OPTION_A,Investigate further. Whatever forces are at work must be put in check. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_33_OPTION_B,Get out of this place as quickly as you can. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_33_RESULT_A_A,"The Aesther in your group leads you to an area off the road that feels...fuzzy. It is hard to focus your vision, as if the space in front of you is only half there. With a few words from the Aesther, the blur is gone."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_33_RESULT_A_B,"You wander around for a while before a massive demon suddenly appears before you, ripped from another plane. Your presence surprises it, though, and you dispatch it before too much trouble is caused."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_33_RESULT_B,"You head forward with all haste, eager to get back your bearings. You seem to be out of the worst of it when you are suddenly ambushed by a giant demon from behind. You fight it<br>off, but not before it tears into you and burns your flesh."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_34_INTRO,"Your travels leave you out in the wilderness overnight, so you make camp and start a fire.<br><br>It’s hard to sleep outside of the comfort of the city, always on guard, looking for the next fatal threat. Luckily the night proves fairly dull. That is, until you hear the sound of voices approaching your camp.<br><br>They are faint and low—almost like growling, but you can hear indications of language."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_34_OPTION_A,Quickly put out the fire and sneak out into the brush to get a look.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_34_OPTION_B,Wait by the fire for whatever comes. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_34_RESULT_A_A,Your stealth skills prove sufficient enough to remain unnoticed by a large group of Inox. You decide to let them pass by without incident.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_34_RESULT_A_B,"You attempt to hide and stay quiet, but a snapped twig at an unfortunate moment startles the passing band of Inox, and they pull out weapons and attack. The scene turns bloody, and you are barely able to fight them off."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_34_RESULT_B_A,"A group of Inox appears at the edge of your campsite. Seeing their kind among you, they greet you in a friendly manner and stay for some time to talk. After they leave, you find the remainder of the night restful."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_34_RESULT_B_B,A group of irate Inox appears at the edge of your campsite. They claim you are trespassing and force you to pack up and leave. You walk through the rest of the night and arrive at your destination tired.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_35_INTRO,"You are enjoying a pleasant, peaceful stroll down the road when you find yourself suddenly surrounded by a beleaguered group of men. One of them steps forward, a pox covering half his face.<br><br>“Good day to you.” He smiles weakly. “We hate to be a burden, but you see, my camp has been taken ill with a strange malady, and we must kindly beg you for some money for medicine.”<br><br>You look around to see that some disfiguring disease has indeed come over the lot of them.<br><br>The man scratches the side of his face with one hand while he slowly pulls out a sword with the other. “I’m afraid we can’t take no for an answer.”"
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_35_OPTION_A,"Fight off the men. This is highway robbery, whatever the motive."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_35_OPTION_B,Pay the men and be on your away. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_35_RESULT_A_A,"The Plagueherald stretches out his arms and the men around him immediately double over in pain. You can almost sense it smiling, even though it doesn’t have a face. The fight doesn’t last long, especially once the men’s wounds start bursting with maggots."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_35_RESULT_A_B,"The men are weakened, but they are still hardened fighters. You fight them off, but it gets ugly."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_35_RESULT_B_A,"You smile as nonthreateningly as you can and reach for your coin purse. You try to give them just a couple coins, but he encourages you to donate more. Eventually the men seem satisfied and move on their way."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_35_RESULT_B_B,"When you try to pay with what few coins you have, the man thinks you are holding out on him and grows angry."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_36_INTRO,"Up ahead, you see the path you are on leads into a dark and unfamiliar wood. It gives you an eerie feeling.<br><br>As you step closer, you can feel your skin crawl and it forces you to pause. You can’t help but think that this wood might best be avoided."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_36_OPTION_A,Continue down the path into the wood. You are not afraid. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_36_OPTION_B,Find another way to your destination. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_36_RESULT_A_A,"The wood is overgrown and rampant with all manner of insects, but with difficulty, you follow the path. Somewhere deep inside, you come across a stone pedestal with some strange runes scratched into its base. Sadly you can't decipher them, but you are in luck, someone has left a small offering on the pedestal itself."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_36_RESULT_A_B,You follow the path into the wood and become hopelessly lost. The going is hard and painful.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_36_RESULT_B,"The wood is large and you spend a little more time than you’d like trying to get around it. With enough effort, you arrive at your destination just a little bit more tired than you’d like."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_37_INTRO,"What starts as a light rain quickly turns into something much worse, with torrents of water battering your skin and lightning piercing the sky.<br><br>You’re able to find a small rock outcropping and rush under it as thunder shakes the ground. This should protect you from the worst of it, but you don’t know how long the storm will last."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_37_OPTION_A,Brave the storm and continue on your way. It's not that bad.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_37_OPTION_B,Wait out the storm under the outcropping. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_37_RESULT_A_A,"You feel positively dismal trudging through the mud and the rain, until you hear the Soothsinger’s voice rise above the thunder. She’s singing a song in the middle of the storm, and everyone starts to feel better."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_37_RESULT_A_B,"Walking down the road in a storm is just awful. You are wet and cold and miserable and you cannot wait for the whole experience to end. By the time you reach your destination, you are not feeling well at all."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_37_RESULT_B,"It is far from ideal, but the outcropping keeps you mostly dry and protects you from the howling wind. You wait hours and hours, huddled up under the rock until the storm passes. By the time you arrive at your destination, you are a bit slow on your feet due to lack of sleep."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_38_INTRO,"It is something small that catches your eye: a button on the ground, glinting in the sun. A button in the shape of an Oak Leaf.<br><br>You stop to investigate, and then you begin to see the bigger things. Splatters of blood in the dirt. Signs of multiple bodies being dragged into the forest.<br><br>You stand and peer into the underbrush. You see a few broken branches and crushed plants. Maybe you could track the bodies through the forest."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_38_OPTION_A,Head off into the forest to find out what happened. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_38_OPTION_B,Move on. That forest does not look friendly. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_38_RESULT_A_A,"You are able to track the trail with ease. It leads to a couple of priests, bloody and unconscious, but still alive. You revive them and bring them back to the main road. They are very grateful."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_38_RESULT_A_B,"You try to follow the trail, but end up getting turned around and lost. Then you have an incredibly difficult and painful time just finding your way back out."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_38_RESULT_B,"Whatever happened here could not have been good, but also it doesn’t concern you and you’re not about to head into that dark, dense forest ill-prepared. You find it best to move along and attend to your own matters."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_39_INTRO,"You see movement in the tall grass to your left, and a weak voice calls out.<br><br>“Help...me...please...”<br><br>You approach the stirring to see a Valrath man writhing on the ground, his skin covered in boils and pus-filled sores.<br><br>“The sickness burns...” he moans at you. “Please...help...”"
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_39_OPTION_A,Help the poor Valrath.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_39_OPTION_B,This is clearly some sort of plague. Avoid it at all costs. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_39_RESULT_A_A,"The Sawbones knows exactly what to do, covering his hands and face as he cleans the wounds. After an hour of tending to him, the Valrath seems good enough to travel."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_39_RESULT_A_B,"You help the Valrath as best you can, but it takes many supplies and potions. When he finally looks better, you realize you are starting to feel sick as a result."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_39_RESULT_B,"You recoil in terror and quickly move along. You can hear the Valrath sobbing as you do so, but you know well enough to avoid a plague when you see it."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_3_INTRO,"You are feeling a tad hungry as you walk down the road. You are considering stopping for a meal when you come across a thicket of bushes covered in red berries. <br><br>The berries look delicious, but you hesitate. They could be poisonous. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_3_OPTION_A,Eat the berries. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_3_OPTION_B,Pass by the berries and just eat your normal rations. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_3_RESULT_A,"You shrug and grab a handful of berries to stuff in your mouth. They are incredibly sweet and just the right amount of tart. You couldn't feel better about your decision. That is, until you start vomiting. Your stomach is incredibly unhappy with you, and the situation doesn't improve much by the time you arrive at your destination. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_3_RESULT_B,"Not wanting to regret making a stupid decision, you refrain from eating the berries and continue on down the road. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_40_INTRO,"There were heavy rains last night for sure, but you didn’t realize the full extent of it until you come face-to-face with a river raging right through the middle of the road. This river is no small matter, either—it is several feet deep and fast-flowing. It’s rather troubling, too, since you have no idea how long it might take to find a decent crossing point."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_40_OPTION_A,"Ford the river where you are. It is not ideal, but it should be possible. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_40_OPTION_B,Head downriver and find a better place to cross. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_40_RESULT_A_A,"With the power of the elements on your side, crossing the river turns out to be incredibly easy. One frozen bridge later, you are on the other side and on your way."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_40_RESULT_A_B,"The water is surprisingly cold, but it will take more than that to end your day. You are still water-logged and shivering when you reach your destination, however."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_40_RESULT_B,"It takes an hour, but you finally find a rocky area where the river has been diverted into many smaller streams. It is no problem to cross, but just finding the spot and then getting back on track takes some of the fire out of you."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_41_INTRO,"Your path is taking you through a small wooded area when you suddenly see a large bear charging directly at you through the trees.<br><br>You may have gotten too close to its den, but you can’t know for sure. All you know is that it is clearly enraged, and you have very little time to react."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_41_OPTION_A,Attempt to calm the bear and back away slowly. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_41_OPTION_B,Arm yourself and fight off the bear. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_41_RESULT_A_A,The Beast Tyrant steps forward with his hand outstretched and makes a low humming sound. The bear stops mid-charge with a perplexed look. You leave the animal there and continue on your way unharmed.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_41_RESULT_A_B,"Two seconds later, you can’t help but feel this was a terrible idea. The bear wounds you severely before you are able to arm yourself and fight it off."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_41_RESULT_B,"You quickly grab your weapons as the bear comes down on you. The fight is brutal and ugly, but it could have been much worse."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_42_INTRO,"A trade caravan passes by you on the road. This event isn’t too uncommon, but what catches your eye is a familiar-looking Inox traveling with the caravan as a guard.<br><br>At the sight of you, the Brute lights up and gives you a big wave, then rushes over to greet you. He is positively joyful to see you and immediately starts to reminisce about all the exciting battles you fought together.<br><br>Slapping you on the back, he implores you to travel with the caravan for a while to give you all a chance to catch up."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_42_OPTION_A,Agree to travel with the Brute for a little while. So what if it’s in the wrong direction?
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_42_OPTION_B,Regretfully leave the Brute to his duties and continue on your way.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_42_RESULT_A,"As you walk with the Brute and talk with him about your early adventuring days, you find a hint of sadness behind his enthusiasm. He explains how he fell on hard times after leaving the group and had to resort to jobs like this to make ends meet. The Brute seems uplifted by your conversation, but the day grows late. By the time you head back and arrive at your destination, you are incredibly tired."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_42_RESULT_B,"You explain to the Brute that you have a long day’s travel ahead of you and cannot take the time to travel in the other direction. As you make your good-byes, a shadow falls over him. He walks away forlorn."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_43_INTRO,"You probably wouldn’t have normally noticed it, but sometimes nature calls and you need to head off the beaten path to get some privacy.<br><br>Hidden in the bushes, you come across the smoking wreckage of some crude machine. It looks to have broken down at some point and was left here to rust and decay.<br><br>Most of it is scrap, but thanks to your time with the Tinkerer, you know a good power core when you see one. It’s a bit heavier than you’d hoped, but it should fetch a good price back in Gloomhaven."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_43_OPTION_A,Take the core with you. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_43_OPTION_B,Leave the core alone. You don't want anything weighing you down in battle.  
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_43_RESULT_A,"The core sure is heavy. You manage it rather well, but it will be a bit of hindrance in battle. You hope the payoff is worth the trouble."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_43_RESULT_B,You decide the risk is not worth the reward and walk away from the contraption before you scratch yourself on the rusted metal and give yourself some foul disease. And just the thought of haggling with the Quatryls in the Mixed District about a fair price makes you tired and irritable.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_44_INTRO,"Due to a late start, night falls before you can get to where you are going. You are on your guard throughout the night, but nothing can quite prepare you for a Night Demon attack.<br><br>They come upon you silent and invisible, so you are unaware of their presence until their claws sink into your flesh.<br><br>The darkness erupts into chaos with flashing swords and horrific shrieks. And then a bolt of fire streaks through the darkness and incinerates one of the demons.<br><br>Someone else is out there."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_44_OPTION_A,Renew your efforts to slay the demons.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_44_OPTION_B,Use the distraction to disengage from the demons and run away. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_44_RESULT_A,"With the help of the mysterious firecaster, the battle turns and the demons are slain without much pain. Out of the darkness steps the familiar face of a female Orchid.<br><br>“Sorry about that. I think they were looking for this.” The Spellweaver holds up a black censer. “It’s a good thing I ran into you, though. I could use your help.”<br><br>She draws out a crude map. “Meet me here as soon as you can, and I’ll explain more.”"
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_44_RESULT_B,"This mysterious third party seems to have things under control, and the demons appear more interested in them anyway. You take the opportunity to retreat from the fight and run off into the night. You don’t feel great about it, but at least you’re alive."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_45_INTRO,"Riding up on horses, a band of dirty, rough men quickly overtake and surround your group. They look hard and dangerous, and you immediately pull out your weapons as they approach.<br><br>Then you hear a familiar laugh.<br><br>“Well, if it isn’t my old crew.” A woman in dark leather armor leaps off her horse to comes greet you. “You know what, boys? This lot gets a pass.”<br><br>She winks at you and turns around. “Plus, they’d probably kill you all if things turned ugly.”<br><br>Jumping back onto her horse, the Scoundrel looks back at you. “Well, it was nice seeing you. Just remember—you never saw me.”"
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_45_OPTION_A,"Attack. Friend or not, those who prey on the weak should be brought to justice."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_45_OPTION_B,Let the bandits go. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_45_RESULT_A,"You see the bandits relax a little and begin to form up. That is when you strike. Some are scared off by the sudden attack, but others engage you hungrily. The Scoundrel throws a few good daggers, too, before she rides off, criticizing your poor decision-making."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_45_RESULT_B,The bandits seem a little disappointed as they form up and ride off in the opposite direction.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_46_INTRO,"Walking among the foothills, you see a steep ridge in front of you, and on top of it, a very odd rock formation.<br><br>The formation calls to you somehow, but the way up is not readily apparent. In fact, climbing the ridge looks pretty dangerous, but you just feel like you need to get up there and look at the rocks."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_46_OPTION_A,Take the risk to climb to the ridge and investigate the rocks.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_46_OPTION_B,Forget about the rocks and continue on your journey. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_46_RESULT_A,"Fearing the possibility of falling from a great height, you choose your steps carefully. Still, the climb to the top takes a long time and is exhausting. Reaching the top, you approach the unnatural rock formation, a giant mound of stones stacked one on top of another. At the base of the bottom stone, you see some strange runes and a small pile of gold."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_46_RESULT_B,"You shake your head and move past the ridge. You have more important things to do than climb rocks. Still, you feel the pull of the site, even after it fades from view. You get the feeling that this won’t be the last time you see it."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_47_INTRO,"A single Vermling jumps out of the brush at you, surprising you briefly. Within moments, though, you have your weapons out and pressed against his throat.<br><br>“EEEEEEEeeeahh!” The Vermling drops his weapon and cowers. “No attack! My brothers in the bushes say you had stink of city-dwelling outcast on you. I wanted to be sure.”<br><br>The Vermling waves his hands. “It’s not bad! Just curious. Being stinky city-dwelling outcast is fine. Please, don’t hurt me!”"
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_47_OPTION_A,"Move on, leave the strange Vermling in peace. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_47_OPTION_B,Kill the savage little beast. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_47_RESULT_A,"“Stink very faint,” the Vermling continues as you walk on. “Outcast no longer with you, but I still smell it!”<br><br>He then jumps back into the brush. Vermlings are very odd creatures."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_47_RESULT_B,"You attack the Vermling anyway, despite his protests. It turns out he wasn’t lying about his “brothers” nearby, though. As you wipe the blood from your blade, ten more of the little furry creatures jump out at you, brandishing small knives. They are not nearly as easy to dispatch."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_48_INTRO,"You see them long before they get close to you—radiant balls of light blazing against the horizon.<br><br>Sun Demons.<br><br>As they approach, you prepare for an attack, but the demons have other plans. They menace you with their glowing claws, but they would rather have information than kill you.<br><br>“Where is the one you call a Sunkeeper?” one of them hisses. “The Valrath neglects her duties, and now we must resolve matters personally.”<br><br>You press for further information, but the demons get angry. “These are not your concerns! Tell us where she is or die at our hands!”"
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_48_OPTION_A,Give them whatever information you can on the Sunkeeper’s whereabouts.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_48_OPTION_B,"Attack the demons. There are a lot of them, but you do not take kindly to threats. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_48_RESULT_A,"You’re not sure exactly what happened to the Sunkeeper after she left the party, but you tell the demons everything you know.<br>They seem satisfied with your response and even offer a bitter thanks as they fly off to the west."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_48_RESULT_B,"Without even speaking, you draw your weapons and attack. The demons are caught off guard, but they bounce back with great ferocity. It is a long, brutal battle, and you continue on in your adventure greatly wounded and bloody."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_49_INTRO,"You are approached on the road by a group of men on horseback. They don’t immediately seem menacing, but they are formidable and well organized.<br><br>One of the men, who wears plate armor and has a sword at his side, addresses you coldly. “You hail from Gloomhaven, correct? What say you about the politics of the place? Are you for or against military rule in the region? Do you think those fool merchants could do a better job, like they’re doing with the rest of this doomed land?”<br><br>Looking closer, you see all the men wear the signet of a tower with an eye at its center."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_49_OPTION_A,Claim allegiance to the military.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_49_OPTION_B,Claim allegiance to the merchant guilds. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_49_RESULT_A,"The armored men seem satisfied with your response and take their hands off their weapons.<br><br>“Good to find some fellow patriots,” the one in front says with a disturbing smile. “You know, we have a stronghold not far from here up in the mountains. Feel free to visit there if you ever get serious about your loyalties.”"
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_49_RESULT_B,"“Well then, today’s your unlucky day,” the man in front says. “Because we of the Vigil make it a point to execute any and all commerce sympathizers we can find in this land.”<br><br>The men grimly draw swords and advance. After a hard battle, the survivors retreat, leaving you to pick through the corpses. Among the loot you find a map."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_4_INTRO,"You see fresh wagon tracks in the dirt as you walk along the road. You continue forward and begin to pick out a number of distinct tracks. They must be from a large caravan. <br><br>Sure enough, as you crest a hill. you see a group of four wagons headed down the road in the same direction as you. You count perhaps three or four guards among them."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_4_OPTION_A,Approach the caravan and offer to travel with them until your paths diverge. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_4_OPTION_B,Attack the caravan. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_4_RESULT_A,"The merchants in the caravan seem grateful, though the guards eye you skeptically. <br>After traveling for half a day without event, you head off down a side road and wave good-bye. The merchants express their appreciation with a bit of coin. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_4_RESULT_B,"With so few guards protecting it, the caravan makes an ideal mark, You charge down the hill, weapons at the ready. The merchants scatter, and the guards are easily dispatched, leaving you with a nice stash of valuables. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_50_INTRO,"Up ahead of you, you see a staff stuck in the very center of the road, pointing straight up out of the ground. You get closer, and an odd sense of foreboding comes over you.<br><br>You recognize the staff as the one wielded by the Summoner. The fact that it now in front of you with such a strange and ominous placement makes you very wary.<br><br>You quickly look around, but nothing else of note is in sight."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_50_OPTION_A,Take the staff and move on. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_50_OPTION_B,Investigate the area and get to the bottom of this. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_50_RESULT_A,"You shrug and grab the staff, half expecting something exciting to happen when you do. Instead, nothing happens at all. In fact, the staff seems rather mundane. You feel no power running through it at all. Still, no sense in leaving it behind. It could be important."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_50_RESULT_B,"You spend a good hour looking over the area, scouring every bush and divot you can find. Unfortunately, you find no other clues about what happened here and end up just tiring yourself out."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_51_INTRO,"You reach a crossroads and decide to rest for a bit. As you eat some of your rations, something sticking up out of the ground in the distance catches your attention.<br><br>You move closer, and what you thought was a signpost turns out to be a human skull impaled on a spike.<br><br>There is something sticking out of the skull’s mouth."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_51_OPTION_A,Investigate further. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_51_OPTION_B,Arm yourself and make a defensive retreat from the area. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_51_RESULT_A,"You get closer to the pike. The skull looks pretty fresh. There are still bits of decayed flesh attached to the bone, and flies buzz around it. You can see there is a small paper card stuck in its mouth, so you carefully reach in and pull it out. The card is black and depicts a skull with blades running through it. Come to think of it, you remember rumors of an assassins’ guild that has been known to use the same imagery. You get out of the area as quickly as you can."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_51_RESULT_B,"You remember rumors of an assassins’ guild that places a skull on a pike outside the houses of their victims before they strike. Fearing the worst, you pull out your weapons and survey the scene as you back away from the pike. Everything looks clear, so you quickly get as far away from the area as possible. Perhaps the skull was not meant for you."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_52_INTRO,"You smell the corpses before you see them. A group of five or so, spread across the road, flies buzzing around in a frenzy.<br><br>As you get closer, you see the wretched, deformed looks on their faces and the boils covering their skin. You also see their crude armor and weapons—likely a group of cutthroats.<br><br>What is truly odd, though, is that their weapons are out of their sheaths in the first place. It appears they were engaged in battle when they suddenly succumbed to some horrible disease.<br><br>You can think of at least one way that could have happened. Fine handiwork from the Plagueherald."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_52_OPTION_A,Leave the corpses alone. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_52_OPTION_B,Inspect the corpses for valuables. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_52_RESULT_A,"Knowing better than to get too close to the machinations of the Plagueherald, you keep a wide berth between you and the corpses and continue down the road."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_52_RESULT_B,"You rifle through the corpses, grabbing stray coins and valuables as you go. You make off with a good haul, but you start feeling sick as soon as you’re done."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_53_INTRO,"You hear the distinctive sound of metal-on-metal in the distance and race up a hill in the road to investigate.<br><br>In front of you, you see a familiar female Inox in heated battle with a group of Gloomhaven guards. Though outnumbered and bloodied, you’ve never seen that stop the Berserker before. With every wound they inflict, she becomes more and more enraged, cleaving off limbs with the ease of cutting grass."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_53_OPTION_A,Help the Berserker fight off the guards. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_53_OPTION_B,Wait and see what happens. It looks like she's handling herself well enough. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_53_RESULT_A,"You enter the battle to aid the Berserker, but in her blood rage, she can’t distinguish friend from foe. She begins hacking away at you with her axe as much as she swings at the guards. You concentrate on taking out the remaining guards, but when you turn back to the Berserker, she seems to have vanished into the nearby forest."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_53_RESULT_B,"After a brutal and bloody fight, only the Berserker remains standing. After her blood rage subsides, she collapses from exhaustion. You race to her side and attempt to revive her using a number of powerful potions. She finally awakes and expresses her begrudging gratitude. You ask about the fight, but she just shakes her head. She offers her axe as thanks and then dashes off into the forest."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_54_INTRO,"Deep inside a dense forest, you begin to hear the jangling of bells and see a small troupe of performers approaching you through the trees.<br><br>“Well, look who it is!” The small voice belongs to a garishly dressed female Quatryl with a lute and a feathered hat. “Fancy running into you out here.” <br><br>“This actually may be a stroke of luck,” the Soothsinger says. “You see, my compatriots and I seem to be a bit lost. We were headed toward the Capital when my drummer said he knew a shortcut. Now here we are in the middle of a forest without an inkling of a clue. I don’t suppose you could find it in your heart to escort us back to the main road, could you?"""
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_54_OPTION_A,Take the time to escort the troupe back out of the forest. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_54_OPTION_B,Give detailed directions about the way out and hope that is sufficient.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_54_RESULT_A,"While escorting the Soothsinger and her troupe out of the forest, you are able to catch up a bit. She is very happy now as a traveling performer, playing to sold-out concerts across the land. When you reach the main road, you say your good-byes and then make the long trek back to where you were going."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_54_RESULT_B_A,You gauge your bearings and then give precise directions on the easiest way out of the forest and back to the main road. The Soothsinger seems impressed and waves good-bye as she heads off.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_54_RESULT_B_B,You hem and haw and then give some vague directions back to the road. The Soothsinger looks at you skeptically and heads off.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_55_INTRO,"You come to a fork in the road. One path looks clear and easy, but the other path is overgrown with thorns and nettles. Either one will likely get you to where you are going.<br><br>The whole situation feels off, though—as if someone or something is watching you.<br><br>Still, a decision must be made."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_55_OPTION_A,Take the clear path.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_55_OPTION_B,Take the overgrown path.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_55_RESULT_A,"You walk down the clear path for a few minutes, and, just when you think the whole weird feeling was your imagination, a group of human bandits jumps out at you from the nearby brush. Before they can engage, however, an arrow suddenly spears the chest of the closest bandit, followed very quickly by a second. The bandits have paused to look around in panic when a third arrow flies into another bandit’s skull. The bandits scatter and run off. You look around for the shooter, but no trace is found."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_55_RESULT_B,"The trek through the overgrown path is unpleasant. You are constantly getting pricked by sharp thorns covered in a strange sap. You think you recognize them from a previous foray into harsh, unforgiving foliage. Sure enough, you start feeling sick pretty soon after you emerge from the bushes."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_56_INTRO,"At first the man looks dead, with numerous open wounds and lying in a pool of blood in the dirt.<br><br>But then he coughs and whispers something unintelligible. The man looks pretty bad off, likely attacked by some wild animal, but it’s possible he could be saved."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_56_OPTION_A,Help the wounded man as best you can.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_56_OPTION_B,Let the man die and take his belongings. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_56_RESULT_A,"The man’s wounds actually look worse than they really are, and your time with the Sawbones has given you some experience in what to do. You bind the wounds to stop the bleeding and then give him something to eat. He lost a lot of blood, but after some nursing, he’s able to stand and make his way back to Gloomhaven, thanking you profusely in the process."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_56_RESULT_B,"You riffle through the man’s pockets as he speaks his last words. They’re too soft to make out, but the tone is one of anger and disappointment. You make off with a decent amount of money and leave the corpse to rot."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_57_INTRO,"You are wandering through an abysmal fog, cursing the very fact you woke up this morning. You can’t see two feet in front of your face and everything is just so cold and damp.<br><br>Walking down what you think is the road, you nearly bump into an elderly Savvas.<br><br>“Ah, how fortuitous is such a meeting,” the Savvas says. “You look like the ones whom my protégé worked with for some time. Normally I would not give the lesser races a second glance, but the master of elements must have seen something in you.”<br><br>It stretches its joints and looks around. “Hmm, you must be having a rough time with this weather. I could offer you something that may help.”"
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_57_OPTION_A,Accept the gift of the Savvas. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_57_OPTION_B,Downplay your struggle and politely decline the Savvas's offer. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_57_RESULT_A,The Savvas concentrates and lays its hand on you. You suddenly feel very warm and all the fog within ten feet of you dissipates.<br><br>“There you go. That should make things easier. The effect should last for at least as long as the fog does. Have a pleasant day!”
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_57_RESULT_B,"“Ah, I see,” the Savvas says. “You’d rather grow from an experience than take the easy way out. A noble path.”<br><br>The Savvas slaps you on the back. “Well, get to it, then! It’s just fog after all. You’ll survive."""
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_58_INTRO,"Despite your best efforts, you find yourself lost in a forest. You thought you were taking a shortcut, but then you got turned around and lost your bearings.<br><br>And just when you think things couldn’t get worse, a wolf suddenly jumps out of the brush in front of you. Oddly, though, it doesn’t appear aggressive. <br><br>It howls once and then slowly and deliberately begins to walk through the trees in front of you, as if expecting you to follow it."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_58_OPTION_A,Follow the wolf.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_58_OPTION_B,Find your own way through the forest. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_58_RESULT_A,"Miraculously, following the wolf leads you right to the edge of the forest and back on track to your destination. The wolf howls once more and then bounds off back into the brush. You can’t help but wonder who might have sent that wolf to assist you."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_58_RESULT_B,"Not willing to trust a wild animal, you refuse to go in the same direction as the wolf and continue down an ill-fated path of your own choosing. It doesn’t go well, and by the time you emerge from the dense forest and find your bearings, you are exhausted."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_59_INTRO,"The air is especially humid and muggy as you walk towards your destination, but even that couldn’t explain the sight that greets you on the road.<br><br>Directly in front of you, completely blocking the only available path, is a massive swarm of insects. There must be millions of them.<br><br>You take a hesitant step forward and the bugs do not react. They are not concerned by your presence at all."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_59_OPTION_A,Cover yourself as best you can and try to walk through the swarm.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_59_OPTION_B,Use whatever you can to burn a path through the swarm. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_59_RESULT_A,"If you were to list the top ten worst moments of your life, this would probably be up there. You walk into the swarm and the insects are everywhere, biting and clawing at your flesh. You move as quickly as you can, emerging from the other side with your life intact but your sanity in shambles. Oddly, though, you also feel as though you were just in the presence of a powerful, divine force."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_59_RESULT_B,"It takes a monumental effort, but you are eventually able to disperse the cloud of insects enough to run through to the other side. As you do so, however, you hear an odd voice among the buzzing, cursing you for your violent actions."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_5_INTRO,"You are traveling through a small wooded area when you round a bend and find a group of Inox warriors fighting a band of armored humans. <br><br>With all the commotion, it's hard to discern more details, but the humans look like guards from Gloomhaven. You are not sure why they would be out here fighting the Inox, though. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_5_OPTION_A,Help the Inox fight off the humans. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_5_OPTION_B,Help the humans fight off the Inox. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_5_RESULT_A,"Fearing the battle could go either way, you charge into the fray, laying low the human attackers. When the dust settles, the Inox offer you a skeptical thanks. <br><br>""Humans think they own all this land,"" one of the Inox says as he spits on the ground. ""We thank you for helping us with the nuisance. Allow us to bless you with a gift."""
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_5_RESULT_B,"With your arrival, the Inox retreat back into the woods, one of them casting hexes as he flees. <br><br>""Blast it all,"" one of the guards says. ""Patrol duty is the absolute worst. No matter what we tell those savages, they're convinced we're going to take over their forest. Anyway, thanks for your help. I thought we were done for."""
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_60_INTRO,"You see smoke on the horizon and sigh, expecting the worst. Sure enough, you approach the scene to find a ransacked caravan—burned, pillaged, and destroyed by what appears to be Vermlings.<br><br>You find one survivor among the victims who laments that when the Vermlings came upon them, one of the guards, a large Inox, seemed to throw aside his weapon and simply accept his fate.<br><br>That’s when you find the body of the Brute, torn and bloody among the wreckage. Seeing him this way, the fire gone from his eyes, he appears unnaturally small."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_60_OPTION_A,Respectfully bury the dead and mourn their loss.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_60_OPTION_B,Take what you can find and move on. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_60_RESULT_A,"Though you didn’t take the time to talk with the Brute earlier, now you take the time to bury his corpse and say a few words about his strength of body and character. The survivor thanks you for your help, and you continue on your way once more."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_60_RESULT_B,"Near the corpse of the Brute, you find an axe, presumably the weapon he threw away. There’s really nothing else among the debris, so you wordlessly pick it up and move on."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_61_INTRO,"You are heading through a small forest when you hear the sound of a woman screaming off to the west. You silently move closer, catching a glimpse of multiple radiant figures through the trees.<br><br>They are Sun Demons, perhaps the same ones who accosted you earlier. That suspicion is confirmed when you get closer and see they are hovering around an armored Valrath woman bound to a tree, torturing her for information.<br><br>“Don’t you see how important this is!” one of the demons says. “Give us the location of the temple!”<br><br>“Lies and tricks of a demon,” the Sunkeeper responds. “The temple is in no danger except from you.”"
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_61_OPTION_A,Leave the scene quietly and return to your own business. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_61_OPTION_B,Attack the demons and free the Sunkeeper. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_61_RESULT_A,"Not wanting to get involved, you simply move on. Eventually the screams of the Sunkeeper fade away."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_61_RESULT_B,"You charge out of the trees and attack the Sun Demons. Fueled by righteous indignation and a bit of guilt, you slay them all. The battle leaves you wounded, but the Sunkeeper happily mends your wounds once you free her.<br><br>“They seemed to think the Sun Temple is under attack by Night Demons,” she says. “I have no reason to believe them, but still, would you mind helping me look into it?”"
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_62_INTRO,"By now, the Sun Demons cut a very recognizable portrait against the horizon as they move toward you. You sincerely had hoped you were done with these creatures.<br><br>“We have urgent need of your assistance,” one of them starts. “Night Demons have infested the Sun Temple. attempting to desecrate it and send the world into eternal darkness.<br><br>“We have tried to stop them, but they are too fortified inside the temple. We regrettably need more strength.<br><br>“Please, you cannot want an absence of a sun on this plane any less than we do. It would be disastrous.”"
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_62_OPTION_A,Agree to help the Sun Demons. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_62_OPTION_B,Attack the Sun Demons. It may be the only way to stop them from bothering you. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_62_RESULT_A,"You sigh and agree, warning them that this had better be the last time they ask you for a favor. They give you the location of the Sun Temple and implore you to hurry."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_62_RESULT_B,"Without even speaking, you draw your weapons and attack. The demons are caught off guard, but they bounce back with great ferocity. It is a long, brutal battle, and you continue on in your adventure greatly wounded and bloody."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_63_INTRO,"As you walk through some foothills, the ground suddenly shakes violently beneath you. Two massive demons built of earth and stone rise up in front of you.<br><br>“Today we shall feast on your flesh, foolish travelers!”<br><br>Just as the demons take a step toward you, a massive ball of fire streaks through the air from behind and connects squarely with one of the demons, which erupts into a pillar of flame. Then lightning streaks toward the other, destroying one of its arms.<br><br>Looking around, you see the old Savvas you met earlier, who continues to throw out powerful attacks until the demons are forced to retreat.<br><br>“Well, fancy meeting you again!”"
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_63_OPTION_A,Thank the Savvas for his timely assistance.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_63_OPTION_B,"Admonish the Savvas, claiming you could have handled the demons without his help. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_63_RESULT_A,"“More and more demons around these parts these days. Stopping them from attacking travelers is becoming a time-intensive job, but at least it’s fun.”<br><br>The Savvas smiles at you and then turns to leave. “Have a pleasant day!”"
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_63_RESULT_B,"The Savvas adopts a look of serious contemplation. “You are right, of course. I presumed to think that a lesser race would need my help, but I forgot your dedication to growth and learning. I have made a grave mistake and must now beg your forgiveness.”<br><br>It holds out a small trinket toward you. “Please, accept this with my apologies.”"
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_64_INTRO,"You reach a crossroads and decide to rest for a bit. As you eat some of your rations, something sticking up out of the ground in the distance catches your attention.<br><br>You move closer, and what you thought was a signpost turns out to be a human skull impaled on a spike.<br><br>There is something sticking out of the skull’s mouth."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_64_OPTION_A,Investigate further. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_64_OPTION_B,Arm yourself and make a defensive retreat from the area. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_64_RESULT_A,"Against your better judgment, you approach the skull, which looks suspiciously like the Sin-Ra’s calling card. Sure enough, a group of dark-clad warriors appears before you from out of thin air. Wordlessly, they draw their long, curved blades and attack. Caught by surprise, you don’t fare well in the battle. You do fight them off, but in the end, you are severely wounded, exhausted, and demoralized."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_64_RESULT_B,"Recognizing the pike as a symbol of the Sin-Ra Syndicate, you arm yourself and run from the area. Unfortunately, you don’t make it far before you see a number of black-clad assassins bearing down on you. You move into a defensive position and prepare for battle. The fight is arduous, but in the end, the assassins are dead, and you hope they don’t come back."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_65_INTRO,"As you crest a hill, you see a flock of carrion birds scatter to the east. They must have been feasting on something, so you decide to investigate.<br><br>After a short walk, you come upon a man’s corpse, badly decayed and mangled, lying in the dirt. His face is a bloody mess, but you do see a distinctive chain around his neck and recall the description the man from the Sleeping Lion gave you of his brother. This is very likely him."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_65_OPTION_A,Bury the man and bring the chain back to his brother. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_65_OPTION_B,Take the chain for yourself and don't tell the brother. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_65_RESULT_A,"Not wanting to tell the brother that you left the corpse out in the sun to rot, you take the time to dig a hole and give it a proper burial. <br><br>When you bring the chain back, the brother is understandably distraught, but he thanks you for giving him closure about what happened."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_65_RESULT_B,"The birds get the corpse. You get the chain. Everyone wins, except the man from the Sleeping Lion. But he should know better than to trust mercenaries."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_66_INTRO,"The first sign of the Inox raiding party was a cloud of dust on the horizon. It was so large, however, there was nowhere to run.<br><br>“City-dwelling scum!” one of the Inox in front calls out to you as you approach. “We march now to attack your city and wipe it from the face of this land. What do you say to that?”<br><br>Your first thought, as you prepare for a fight, is that they will need a larger army. Before you can strike, though, the sky grows dark. You assume it is a cloud, but then look up to see a giant drake descending on you from above."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_66_OPTION_A,Take cover.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_66_OPTION_B,Attack the Inox. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_66_RESULT_A,"You jump into a ditch and cover your head just as the Elder Drake glides over the raiding party, breathing a heavy gout of flame into their midst. Those not incinerated scream and flee for their lives. The drake lands in front of you.<br><br>“Intrepid adventurers! I hope I was able to offer you some aid against your aggressors. It really was my pleasure after all you have done for me. I hope you find some things of value among the corpses. It is my gift to you.”"
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_66_RESULT_B,"You attack the large group of Inox while they are distracted by giant creature above you. Things suddenly get very hot, however, when the drake begins spitting fire into the melee. The Inox scatter and you are suffering from severe burns when the Elder Drake lands in front of you.<br><br>“My apologies. I was only trying to help.”"
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_67_INTRO,"Not too far down the main road outside of Gloomhaven, you run across a merchant wagon headed into town.<br><br>“Ah, I was afraid for a second you might be bandits!” The merchant says. “But now I see you are mercenaries from the town, correct? Most excellent! I have heard good things about the mercenaries of Gloomhaven. Hard to believe, coming from such a backwater place, but they are true, correct?”"
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_67_OPTION_A,Demonstrate your virtue by offering to escort the merchant back to Gloomhaven.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_67_OPTION_B,Demonstrate your lack of virtue by robbing the merchant.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_67_RESULT_A,"“Ah, well...no, I don’t want to be a bother. But, I mean, yes, I can’t pay you, though I’d love the company. It is rather terrifying traveling the East Road by yourself.”<br><br>It is a relatively short journey back to town, but the merchant is very grateful. “I am quite impressed, sirs. I’ll be sure to tell everyone back in the capital that Gloomhaven is a safe place to do business.”"
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_67_RESULT_B,"“Well, I just—I mean, I’d never...” the merchant trails off incredulously. “To think there are places in the world where such barbarism still exists. It boggles the mind.<br><br>“I’m going to tell everyone back in the Capital what a horrible, backward shrrggggllg...” Blood bubbles up into his mouth as you slit his throat, making it very difficult for him to continue complaining."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_68_INTRO,"Not too far down the main road outside of Gloomhaven, you run across a merchant wagon headed into town.<br><br>“Oh no...ah, mercenaries, I see,” the merchant stammers as you approach. “Look, ah, I know the reputation of your like around Gloomhaven. Please, just take what you want and move on. I-I don’t want any trouble.”"
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_68_OPTION_A,Take what you want and move on.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_68_OPTION_B,Calm the merchant and explain that not all mercenaries are bloodthirsty thieves. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_68_RESULT_A,"The merchant remains dead silent as you sift through his cart and pull out any valuables. There’s not a whole lot in his wares, but the ease in which you are able to take what he has makes it all the sweeter.<br><br>Once you are finished, you continue on your way and he continues on his."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_68_RESULT_B,"“Oh, ah, really?” The merchant looks at you incredulously. “Well then, color me embarrassed. I sincerely apologize for my uneducated assumptions. Sometimes you just expect the worst traveling to such backwater locales.<br><br>“I’ll be sure to tell everyone I see that not everyone in Gloomhaven is a criminal,” he says as he rides off, tipping his hat to you."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_69_INTRO,"Walking along the trail, you are surprised by a group of demons who appear to your left, charging over a hill toward you. Something is off, however. Their pace is slow, and they are significantly smaller than the demons you normally deal with.<br><br>Halfway down the hill, the demons pause and take stock of you. Seeing you are far from easy prey, they turn around and begin to retreat."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_69_OPTION_A,Chase them down quickly and kill them.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_69_OPTION_B,"Follow them more slowly, attempting to discover where they came from. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_69_RESULT_A,"You roar and charge up the hill. The demons are no match for you, either in speed or in strength. You kill them quickly but painfully."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_69_RESULT_B,"You creep slowly to the crest of the hill, watching as the demons retreat to the south. You follow them, eventually arriving at a weak, fluctuating rift in a small, earthen cave. Having experienced enough planar manipulation in your travels, you are able to mutter a few incantations and close the rift. It takes a lot out of you, but now there is one less way for demons to invade this plane."
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_6_INTRO,"Stumbling through the woods, you are alarmed to hear the sudden sounds of a large animal rummaging through the underbush. You crouch down, gauging the grunts and growls. <br><br>Through the trees, you see a large bear approaching your location. It has not noticed you yet, but you imagine it will soon. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_6_OPTION_A,Take the opportunity to run from the bear before it gets any closer.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_6_OPTION_B,"Attack the bear, hopefully catching it by surprise. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_6_RESULT_A,"You bolt from hiding as fast as you can. Luckily the bear was still a ways off, and it gets bored with the chase before it can catch you. Still, you keep running and running until you can't catch your breath.  "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_6_RESULT_B,"The bear roars as you approach, making powerful swipes with its claws. Still, with the surprise and the commotion, the bear is not all that committed to the fight. After a bit of back and forth, the animal grunts and runs off into the trees. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_7_INTRO,"Walking along the edge of a forest, you begin to hear strange, unfamiliar sounds coming from beyond the trees. You stop and listen closer. <br><br>There's a rhythm to the sounds, and with that established, you begin to pick out different human voices in the mix. You'd venture to say that the noise vaguely sounds like chanting.  "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_7_OPTION_A,Head into the forest to investigate the chanting. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_7_OPTION_B,Keep moving on down the road. No need to get mixed up in whatever is going on.  
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_7_RESULT_A,"You quietly move through the forest toward the noise. Eventually you come upon a clearing where you see a circle of cultists performing some strange ritual. One of them notices you and shouts to the others. The situation devolves into a bloody battle. You are, of course, victorious, but it saps some of your strength. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_7_RESULT_B,"Without a second thought, you get back onto the main road and continue moving toward your destination. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_8_INTRO,"You see a lone man walking toward you on the road. As you meet on the path, he turns to you and begins to speak.<br><br>""Oi there. I wouldn't suppose you lot might spare me some coin?"" he asks. ""A lotta coin, actually.""<br><br>You look at him quizically as he continues. ""You see, I lead a lotta thieves and bandits in this area and we gotta make sure all the mouths are fed.""<br><br>At this, a large number of bandits come out of hiding around you, emerging from the bushes. <br><br>""So about that coin,"" the man says with a smile. ""Five gold per head oughta do it."""
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_8_OPTION_A,Pay the thieves.
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_8_OPTION_B,"Resist the robbery, killing as many thieves as you can. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_8_RESULT_A,"You sigh, and hand over what coins you have.<br><br>The man maintains his grin. ""Well, thank you kind sirs. It was a pleasure meeting you, and have a pleasant day!""<br><br>The bandits move off in one direction as you continue in the other.  "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_8_RESULT_B,"Unfazed by the ambush, you draw your weapons and attack the bandits in the bushes. The leader tries to withdraw, but you cut him down as well. There are a lot of bandits, but they don't put up too much of a fight. They seem weak and malnourished. You guess the leader wasn't kidding about needing to buy food. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_9_INTRO,"Walking through a stretch of lowlands, you see a man in armor sitting against a large boulder. As you get closer, you see he is bleeding from his side. <br><br>""Ah, what luck,"" he says. ""I got separated from my detail and then had an unfortunate run-in with a bear. I'm afraid I no longer have the strength to stand.""<br><br>He looks at you imploringly. ""You wouldn't happen to have a potion or something you would be willing to give me? I just need a little extra energy to make it back to Gloomhaven."""
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_9_OPTION_A,Help out the guard. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_9_OPTION_A_UNAVAILABLE,No small items equipped
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_9_OPTION_B,Claim you have no aid to give and move on. 
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_9_RESULT_A,"You happily oblige the request, letting the man partake some of your supplies. He slowly stands up, thanks you, and then heads toward Gloomhaven as you head in the opposite direction. "
EVENT_ROAD_CAMPAIGN_9_RESULT_B,"You adopt an expression of regret and apologize for a lack of supplies. You then quickly move on your way as he shouts at your back. <br><br>""But... please! You're not just going to leave me here, are you?"""
EVENT_RopeBridge,"The path leads you to a ravine, with a rickety old rope bridge as the only way across as far as you can see. The ropes look very worn and the wooden planks rather rotten, but looking for another way across looks like it could take quite some time."
EVENT_RopeBridge_A,Cross the rope bridge
EVENT_RopeBridge_AnotherWay,"You're in luck! Not too far along the edge of the ravine you find a large tree has fallen to form a makeshift bridge across thanks to a storm. It appears to be far more sturdy than the rotten rope bridge, so you make your way across without issue."
EVENT_RopeBridge_AnotherWay_Gained,"You walk and walk for the rest of the day and still do not find a way across. As dusk falls you finally find the end of the ravine, allowing you to cross over and make the long walk back to the path on the other side, so exhausted by this unexpected detour that you feel a headache coming on."
EVENT_RopeBridge_B,Try to find another way across
EVENT_RopeBridge_Cross,"The rope bridge creaks and sways precariously under your weight with each step, but nonetheless holds and you make it to the other side without issue. You breathe a sigh of relief and continue with your journey."
EVENT_RopeBridge_Cross_Lost,The rope bridge creaks and sways precariously under your weight with each step. You nearly make it across when it suddenly one of the planks snaps and you fall from the bridge!<br><br>You just manage to catch one of the ropes that held the plank before you would fall into the ravine – but a small pouch of gold flies from your belt and disappears into the darkness below.<br><br>You pull yourself up and cautiously make it the rest of the way to the other side. You breathe a sigh of relief after such a close call and continue with your journey.
EVENT_ShadowsontheWall,"The road you are on leads you to a narrow cliffside path. As the only route in sight to reach the bottom, you begin your descent."
EVENT_ShadowsontheWall_A,Descend
EVENT_ShadowsontheWall_Descent,"You notice the cliff face here is becoming smoother as you descend. Mysterious etchings and carvings start to emerge as you examine the wall. They begin to morph into shadows that swirl and dance about the surface, seemingly leading you along the wall to a spot on the ground.<br><br>Tucked into a small alcove at the base of the wall lies an urn, with a small quantity of coins inside."
EVENT_ShadowsontheWall_Descent_A,Make an offering
EVENT_ShadowsontheWall_Descent_A_Subtext,(Lose ¬ShadowsOnTheWall_Offering.GoldAmount¬ Gold)
EVENT_ShadowsontheWall_Descent_B,Take the gold

EVENT_The WomanoftheWoods_GotPower,"She smiles a toothless grin, and snaps her fingers and vanishes. You suddenly feel full of energy, all aches and pains gone in an instant. Freshly invigorated, you journey onwards."
EVENT_The WomanoftheWoods_GotXP,"""A wise choice indeed!"" she replies. She waves her hands and you fall to the floor, blacking out. When you wake up, the woman is nowhere to be seen, but you feel your skills have improved."
EVENT_The WomanoftheWoods_Leave,"Wary of strange old women that suddenly jump out of the treeline at you, you decide not to answer her and hastily leave the area."
EVENT_TheFunGuy,"Walking through a wooded glade, you notice something buried in the undergrowth. Upon closer inspection, you see that it is the body of an Inox face down on the ground, clearly long dead. Mushrooms have begun sprouting in clusters all over the decomposing body, and it is giving off a foul stench.<br><br>Looking for anything of value on the corpse, you see that the majority of the Inox's gear is far too rotten to be of any use.

Unable to bear the stench of the corpse any longer, you take the gold and hurriedly leave the area."
EVENT_TheFunGuy_TryTakingBoots_Poison,"As you remove the boots, they begin to fall apart, and large chunks of putrid flesh from the Inox's feet come off with them. A cloud of spores ejects from the mushrooms disturbed by your removal of the boots and engulfs the party.<br><br>You are overwhelmed with a feeling of nausea and jump back from the corpse, but it is too late – you are poisoned. You toss the sodden boots aside and continue through the glade, feeling awful."
EVENT_TheLongDead,"The path is getting less and less distinct as you traverse through the thick forested area. After a while you come to the conclusion that you must have taken a wrong turn, and attempt to find your way back to the path.<br><br>Whilst searching for the path, you happen upon the remains of an old campfire in a small clearing, surrounded by the skeletal remains of several bodies on the ground.

You look over to the large tree you nearly considered to use as shelter, just as it is struck by lightning and explodes!<br><br>You breathe a great sigh of relief for having chosen the sensible option, and reflect upon your experience as you wait out the storm."
EVENT_TheStorm_Investigate,"You approach the spot where the lightning seems to be focused, catching a glimpse of a metallic object protruding from the ground in the flash from a lightning strike. It seems that this object is acting as a lightning rod, attracting the strikes with unusual consistency for something so small – it could quite possibly be an artefact with magical properties."

EVENT_TheStorm_Investigate_B,Ignore the item and seek shelter
EVENT_TheStorm_SeekShelter,"Eager to get out of the rain, you see a large tree up ahead which you could use for cover – alternatively you could double back on yourself to a bridge over a muddy creek you saw earlier."

EVENT_TheStorm_Tree,"The branches offer some slight protection from the rain as you wait for the storm to pass – when suddenly, the tree you are under is struck by lightning! The trunk explodes violently, sending splinters and fragments flying in all directions. As if being pelted with bits of burning tree wasn't bad enough, the lightning conducts through the party, leaving you all thoroughly shocked.<br><br>In searing pain, you stumble in the direction of the bridge to wait out the storm under, having learned a valuable lesson about not using trees for shelter in a thunderstorm."
EVENT_TollRoad,"The path leads you to a narrow passage between two rocky outcrops. You are about to make your way through when several hooded figures suddenly step out from behind the rocks.<br><br>'Halt!'<br><br>The largest of the men steps towards you.

EVENT_TollRoad_Fight_Gained,"You attempt to take down the bandit leader before he can react, but he is faster than you expect for a man of his stature. He catches you with a wide horizontal slash with his dagger, before falling after a blow to the head. Injured but undaunted, you turn to take on the rest of his goons.<br><br>Clearly no match for the likes of you, within seconds they all lie dead on the ground. You claim the coin purse from the bandit leader's belt as a prize, and continue through the passage."

LOADING_TIP_007,"Look for synergies not only between your cards, but also the cards of your other party members."
LOADING_TIP_008,"Move abilities on the top half of a card and Attack abilities on the bottom half of a card are uncommon, but can be especially useful."
LOADING_TIP_009,You can adjust the difficulty to your liking if you find yourself struggling or craving a challenge.

LOADING_TIP_011,You can press Tab to see the order in which enemies of the same type will act.

LOADING_TIP_014,"Choose your party before travelling – once you are on your way, you can no longer switch out party members."
LOADING_TIP_015,"For those really tough missions in Guildmaster mode, consider seeking a blessing from the Temple beforehand."
LOADING_TIP_016,Guildmaster's Job quests have a chance of spawning a chest – be sure to loot it before finishing the scenario objectives!
LOADING_TIP_017,Be careful when equipping new Items – they'll be bound to that mercenary. You'll have to pay to re-equip them elsewhere.
LOADING_TIP_018,"You can unlock more enhancement types by completing achievements, and more slots per mercenary by exploring the map."
LOADING_TIP_019,Guildmaster's Travel and Job quests scale as you play through the game. Story and Relic quests tend to be tougher!
LOADING_TIP_020,Not all scenarios require all enemies to be killed to be completed – be sure to check your objectives.
LOADING_TIP_021,"Allies can be helpful in scenarios, but are often a little reckless – try to divert attacks from them to keep them alive!"
LOADING_TIP_022,"If you are unsure if you will get to act early or late, consider picking a pair of cards that can be useful regardless of when you get to act."
LOADING_TIP_023,"Observe the enemy moves and learn their decks and abilities. Some creatures are consistently fast and others slow, which is knowledge you can use to your advantage."
LOADING_TIP_024,You can press L to see the Line of Sight display.
LOADING_TIP_025,"Each card half you select for a player character's turn is an action, and is comprised of one or more abilities."
LOADING_TIP_026,"An action with a specified type means that at least one of the abilities within are of that type. For example, a ""Move action"" contains at least one Move ability."

LOADING_TIP_040,"Bless <sprite name=Bless> adds a BLESS (x2) card to the target's attack modifier deck. When drawn, the attack deals double damage, and the BLESS is removed from the deck."
LOADING_TIP_041,"Monsters share an attack modifier deck, so if a monster receives a Curse or Bless, it could be another monster that draws that effect!"
LOADING_TIP_042,"Note that abilities that remove negative conditions, such as Cure potions, can not remove Curses from the attack modifier deck."
LOADING_TIP_043,"There is a 10 Curse limit shared between mercenary attack modifier decks, and another separate limit of 10 for the monster attack modifier deck. Trying to add an 11th Curse to any deck will have no effect!"
LOADING_TIP_044,There is a shared 10 Bless limit among all attack modifier decks. Trying to add a Bless to any attack modifier deck while 10 Blesses are already in play will have no effect!

LOADING_TIP_046,Stay hydrated!

Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_BeastTyrantReachLevel2_1,The Beast Tyrant has come to me with information that Rot is spreading across the land.
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_BeastTyrantReachLevel2_2,He is able to converse with some small communities of wild creatures and he has offered our help.
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_BeastTyrantReachLevel2_3,That was kind of him!
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_BeastTyrantReachLevel2_4,"In response, they will help us against the Rot, it starts near Sweetwater."
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_BerserkerReachLevel2_1,We’ve received word that the Overseer has returned to Gloomhaven.
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_BerserkerReachLevel2_2,"He’s dangerous, and he’s got history with the Berserker's clan, so I’m letting her lead the investigation. You need to find him and take him down."
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_BruteReachLevel2_1,"An old friend has contacted the Brute with regards to a caravan guard mission he needs help with, go check it out."
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_CragheartReachLevel2_1,It is time for the Cragheart to start their pilgrimage to the holy Savvas shrines in the area. The Temple of the Winds can be found here.
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_DoomstalkerReachLevel2_1,The Doomstalker has unfortunately heard that his settlement outside South Shield was attacked during our last mission. He’d like to track down those responsible.
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_DoomstalkerReachLevel2_2,Can’t the City Guard handle this?
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_DoomstalkerReachLevel2_3,"I’ve already asked the Guard Captain to look into it, but he says he’s got more important problems to worry about."
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_DoomstalkerReachLevel2_4,I suppose we should investigate then. The City Guard might as well start sending us a steady salary at this rate...
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_ElementalistReachLevel2_1,"The Elementalist has been researching Swagger, a Hero from hundreds of years past who had mastered both Melee and Magic combat."
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_ElementalistReachLevel2_2,I’ve told them to investigate the ruined village of Mudchute near Bloodford. Maybe they can find out how to bolster their own melee abilities!
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_MindthiefReachLevel2_1,"The Mindthief has received a hastily-scrawled note from the others in her nest under Demonsgate, warning that humans are threatening her home."
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_NightshroudReachLevel2_1,"Now the Nightshroud is firmly part of the team, he has indicated to me that he wants to research some of the rarer enemies found around the land."
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_NightshroudReachLevel2_2,How does he want to research them?
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_NightshroudReachLevel2_3,By killing them and dissecting their corpses.
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_NightshroudReachLevel2_4,"Oh, ‘that’ kind of research?"
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_NightshroudReachLevel2_5,Yes. First he’s suggesting heading to The Pyre to collect Spirit ectoplasm.
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_PlagueheraldReachLevel2_1,"The Plagueherald has been studying how best to save Demonsgate from disease, and believes it has come across a breakthrough. <br>"
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_PlagueheraldReachLevel2_2,Are you sure you’re talking about the glorified cloud of bugs that likes infecting things?<br>
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_PlagueheraldReachLevel2_3,"The Plagueherald thought disease helped the other races. When the Enchantress managed to convince it otherwise, its hive began studying Demonsgate to create a magical cure-all instead."
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_PlagueheraldReachLevel2_4,And it actually thinks it has MADE that magic cure?
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_PlagueheraldReachLevel2_5,"Yes, and it would like to relay the news to its hive."
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_PlagueheraldReachLevel2_6,"Well I don’t want to give it a reason to experiment on me, so I suppose we had better go. I don’t know why we ever let it join us..."
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_QuartermasterReachLevel2_1,The Quartermaster has heard from an old colleague in Demonsgate that one of their City Guard equipment stockpiles inside the central vault has been raided.
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_QuartermasterReachLevel2_2,How much did they take? Some of that equipment is worth a fortune!
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_QuartermasterReachLevel2_3,"Pretty much everything, enough to outfit a small army… The Quartermaster has been tasked by Demonsgate to investigate."
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_QuartermasterReachLevel2_4,"We would head straight there, but the vault’s guards were slaughtered — and it appears the thief stole their vault key, too."
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_QuartermasterReachLevel2_5,I heard Lowtown holds a spare key for the vault. We can head there.
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_SawbonesReachLevel2_1,I’ve heard that the cobblers of Demonspine Hollow and their families have been experiencing an uncomfortable amount of freak accidents in their workshops lately. <br>
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_SawbonesReachLevel2_2,"While strange, it’s consistent enough to make me suspicious of magical foul-play."
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_SawbonesReachLevel2_3,"The Sawbones has already told me about the reports. He’s asked if we can investigate – for free, seeing as it would be his sacred duty as a healer of The Great Oak."
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_SawbonesReachLevel2_4,"And you agreed!? Of course you did. Well, it is always easier to extort people for their life savings once they’re grateful to you I suppose. Let’s go. "
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_ScoundrelReachLevel2_1,"I woke up this morning and found a letter outside the front door. It's for the Scoundrel, and asks for a rendezvous in the forest. Can I not be the middle man in future please?"
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_SoothsingerReachLevel2_1,"The Soothsinger asked my advice on places she could go to get inspiration for a few new songs, and I suggested visiting one of the less bloodthirsty Bandit gangs."
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_SoothsingerReachLevel2_2,There is a group up near Gibbet Hill who might be able to help out.
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_SpellweaverReachLevel2_1,"We have received a missive for the Spellweaver from the Aesther community, asking for help investigating a disturbance in the magical equilibrium in the Eastern Forest. "
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_SpellweaverReachLevel2_2,I'll mark it on your map.
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_SummonerReachLevel2_1,"The Summoner has reported a... “shift among the planes” outside Wayward, and has suggested we investigate."
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_SummonerReachLevel2_2,A shift among the planes? What does that even mean?
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_SummonerReachLevel2_3,"‘The first impossible connection of two incompatible planes, which must be studied.’ That’s what she told me when I asked her that."
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_SummonerReachLevel2_4,That sounds bad. We should probably do something about that.
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_SunkeeperReachLevel2_1,The Sunkeeper has advised me that she wishes to use her newly found abilities to do good in the land.
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_SunkeeperReachLevel2_2,I’ve identified a Vermling Camp near Wayfarer’s Rest that has recently been attacked which may need our help.
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_SunkeeperReachLevel2_3,But how will they pay us?.. I don’t understand!
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_TinkererReachLevel2_1,The Tinkerer has been studying the origins of Demonology in an effort to try and help defeat them. He's identified somewhere we should investigate.
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_UnlockLocations_1,"You've made a good start on heading South West, and we've got a few more towns contacting us for help, all the way to the coast!"
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_UnlockLocations_2,"Err, boss, there is an Aesther woman here who wants to see you. She says she might be able to help us..."
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_UnlockLocations_3,"What you are doing... reconnecting people, driving back the darkness, and preserving the weak, I deem it worthy."
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_UnlockLocations_4,"I shall grant you access to my Enhancements. Come visit my tent, and together we shall improve your warriors' prowess. The more towns you unlock, the more powerful you can become."
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_UnlockLocations_5,"Well, she was straight to the point!"
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_1_UnlockLocations_6,"An Enchantress! Be aware, her services don't come cheap. Now we have unlocked more of the world, prepare for the danger to increase. But don't worry, the rewards will follow suit. I've also unlocked some more Achievements to aim for."
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_2_ReachDemonspineHollow_1,"After looking in more detail into the area around LowTown, we have found some strange crystals piled up in the forest."
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_2_ReachDemonspineHollow_2,"They emit an incredibly strong aura of Earth Magic, and look to have been the cause of the weird behaviour of the Vermlings, as well as the enhanced magical power in the area."
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_2_ReachDemonspineHollow_3,We are getting reports of similar magical deviations around the town of Fordingbridge to the South.
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_2_ReachFordingbridge_1,"While exploring Fordingbridge a rather unpleasant individual accosted me in the street, he was dripping with what only I can describe as raw sewage."
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_2_ReachFordingbridge_2,"I initially waved him away, but he told me he was from the Sweetwater town Council, I laughed, but he was adamant."
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_2_ReachFordingbridge_3,"Apparently they have a problem they need looking into. I told him we would investigate it to make him go away, I'll mark Sweetwater on your map."
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_2_ReachTheSloshedSquirrel_1,I was.. doing some 'important business' in The Sloshed Squirrel and I heard some worrying news from the patrons.
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_2_ReachTheSloshedSquirrel_2,"It seems travellers to Amberhill have been going missing, and the whole town is in lockdown."
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_2_ReachTheSloshedSquirrel_3,"Probably worth our while going to check it out and see if we can help or err, make some money?"
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_2_UnlockLocations_1,We've reached the coast! That's the first part of the realm reconnected.
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_2_UnlockLocations_2,I've also been contacted by some outposts in the Eastern forest. We should start to look there for work too.
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_2_UnlockLocations_3,I'll add that to the next set of Achievements to attain!
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_3_UnlockLocations_1,"We're a good way through the forest now, and I've had more contacts come in, this time, from the Badlands to the north."
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_3_UnlockLocations_2,"Beware though, I've heard rumours of Drakes and Demons. It's not a place for the faint of heart!"
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_4_UnlockLocations_1,"The Badlands is well explored now, and we are starting to receive messages from the Great Forest even further north."
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_4_UnlockLocations_2,Let's seek out the outposts further North. They are surely to have some impressive equipment to trade!
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_4_UnlockLocations_3,Our last Objective now is to reach Wildspire in the depth of the forest.
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_5_UnlockLocations_1,"Well done! All the towns to the Barren Coast, the Eastern Forest, The Badlands and up to the Great North Forest have been connected. The first chapter of our Guild's history is complete!"
Message_Complete_Achievement_1_5_UnlockLocations_2,It seems the villages of the realm have banded together to reward us with a nice pile of gold coins!
Message_End_Quest_Story_2D_1,Great work getting through the basic training missions. Allow me to introduce you to the third member of the Guild; he ain't much of a fighter though...
Message_End_Quest_Story_2D_2,"Hey, not all of us particularly care to be experts at stabbing people!<br><br>Oh, err... please excuse me. *Ahem*"
Message_End_Quest_Story_2D_3,"Greetings, guildmaster. I'm the humble <b>Merchant</b> of your fledgling Guild. I deal with the important aspects of running a Guild... in other words, <i>money</i>. Which, might I add, is sorely lacking at the moment..."
Message_End_Quest_Story_2D_4,"What you can see right now is the <b>World Map</b>. You've probably noticed it looks a bit barren at the moment, and, well... I've got some good news and some bad news for you.<br><br>The bad news is that the realm has been overrun with all manner of unpleasant monsters — rogue bandits, wandering undead, dark cultists, you name it. The good news is that you're going to help us restore the routes back to the other settlements out there, hidden in the fog."
Message_End_Quest_Story_2D_5,"Before we can do anything about that however, we'll need to get some mercenaries on the Guild roster. Let's start with actually recruiting the poor old <b>Brute</b>, who's got himself into a spot of bother... again."
Message_End_Quest_Story_3A_1,"The <b>Brute</b> sure can soak up damage well, but he’s not the most mobile."
Message_End_Quest_Story_3A_2,"Having ample funds is going to be of utmost importance in getting this Guild off the ground. Do you know anyone good at... erm, gold acquisition?"
Message_End_Quest_Story_3A_3,"I know just the woman — she’s also a dab hand at poking holes in those who get in her way. She's in the process of liberating some gold right now, shall we lend her a hand?"
Message_End_Quest_Story_3B_1,"The first thing we should do as a Guild is re-establish the trade route with Gibbet Hill to the West. We’ve been having a small problem with bandits in the woodland en route, but with the Brute and Scoundrel to assist, that's nothing that should cause you any trouble."
Message_End_Quest_Story_3B_2,"It’ll give you some much needed experience on the job, and allow me to get some new <b>item</b>s in stock once the way is cleared. Go knock some bandit heads together!"
Message_End_Quest_Story_4A_1,"It's about time you learned about the fundamentals of magic. I know a <b>Spellweaver </b>who should be able to show you a thing or two, and last I heard from her, she was researching a stone circle in a forest nearby Gibbet Hill. With all these monsters about, we ought to check she's OK."
Message_End_Quest_Story_5A_1,That's the elemental schools of magic covered. Perhaps we could do with recruiting someone who understands hi-tech contraptions and such? I swear there was a Quatryl <b>Tinkerer</b> messing about with a power core or some other artifact in the tavern not too long ago...
Message_End_Quest_Story_5A_2,"Good call. I heard he was looking for fellow explorers to investigate a tomb nearby, barkeep said he set off yesterday. Sounds to me like the sort who might be interested in joining a Guild such as our own — let's see if we can find him!"
Message_End_Quest_Story_5B_1,"We're getting a proper mercenary guild together now! Speaking of paid jobs, I've met someone who has requested our help."
Message_End_Quest_Story_5B_2,"Peace be with you. I am the <b>Priestess</b> here, sworn to the Sanctuary of the Great Oak. I thank you for meeting with me, as we at the Sanctuary are in dire need of assistance.<br><br>You see, the holy crypt in the catacombs beneath the Sanctuary has been broken into and defiled by deranged cultists, raising hordes of undead to do their nefarious bidding... I beg of thee, please help us be rid of this menace!"
Message_End_Quest_Story_5B_3,"All too common an occurrence these days... Anyhow, sounds like an opportunity to try out our two latest recruits together — get to it."
Message_End_Quest_Story_5C_1,"I cannot express just how grateful I am... Truly, thank you. With the threat to the Sanctuary gone, we can finally resume the restoration of the Temple here. It will be some time before we are ready to resume our normal services, but I hope we can be of help in the future. I bid you farewell."
Message_End_Quest_Story_5C_2,"Hang on a second, we did that for <i>free</i>?! I thought we were supposed to be looking for paid jo— Oh, never mind...<br><br><size=90%>Join a guild, they said... <size=80%>It'll be fun, they said... <size=70%>""You'll make heaps of gold""... Pfft! <size=60%>*Grumble grumble*"
Message_End_Quest_Story_5C_3,"Don't mind him. Thanks to you, the Temple will reopen in due time, and you will be glad to receive their blessings.<br><br>Now, the next village we've lost contact with is The Marches. The route is under lockdown after a number of raids from small bands of Vermlings camping nearby."
Message_End_Quest_Story_5C_4,"I want you to head up North and see if you can drive them out.<br><br>Oh, and watch out for their hounds. Let these scars across my face be a warning to you — you get up close to those dogs and they'll bite back!"
Message_End_Quest_Story_6A_1,"Just one more route to clear, and I should have re-established contact with enough suppliers to reopen my shop for business! I'm sure you can't wait to get your hands on some decent gear."
Message_End_Quest_Story_6A_2,"There's some incentive for you! As your core training nears its end, I hope you are getting used to how the various abilities and effects interact with each other. You'll certainly be needing some advanced techniques on the quests to come!"
Message_End_Quest_Story_6A_3,"Anyhow, I’ve tracked down a potential fifth mercenary for our crew, if you can get him on board. This guy has fists of stone, and I mean literally! "
Message_End_Quest_Story_7A_1,<b>Cragheart</b>'s on board - that’s five mercenaries recruited! I reckon just one more and we should have a large enough crew to take on some quests further out from Demonsgate.
Message_End_Quest_Story_7A_2,"Y'know, if we can find someone capable of summoning allies to the battlefield, it'll feel like we have even more mercs still! I know some Vermlings are quite proficient at handling beastly brethren of theirs."
Message_End_Quest_Story_7A_3,Vermlings? We're going to recruit a Vermling?
Message_End_Quest_Story_7A_4,"Don't let the rodent exterior fool you, they aren't all feral scavengers. Some Vermlings develop strong psychic abilities — and rumour has it one such Vermling <b>Mindthief</b> is hunting down demons nearby. Would you say no to a demon hunter joining the Guild just because she looks a bit rattish?<br><br>I vote we find this <b>Mindthief</b> and see if she fancies joining us for a chance at greater glory... than hunting demons. Okay, perhaps not <i>greater</i> glory just yet, but glory all the same."
Message_End_Quest_Story_7B_1,"Now we’ve got the Guild going, we're starting to get job requests coming in from far and wide. I'm also hearing rumours regarding the locations of powerful artifacts that could be worth investigating."
Message_End_Quest_Story_7B_2,"In fact, you should check this one out first: A few nights ago a falling star was said to have been seen landing in a forest clearing near Gibbet Hill, but when villagers went to investigate, there was no trace of anything having landed there."
Message_End_Quest_Story_7B_3,"A day or so later, they started experiencing minor earthquakes emanating just north of the village, not far from the clearing. Nothing up there except an old, decrepit crypt - and the villagers, being villagers, are too scared to investigate. "
Message_End_Quest_Story_7B_4,"Sounds like a magical artifact of some kind to me, you should go check it out!"
Message_End_Quest_Story_7B_5,"I recommend you bring along the <b>Cragheart</b> and <b>Mindthief</b>, they should easily be up to the task."
Message_End_Quest_Story_7C_1,"And so, that concludes your training. The world is your oyster — a bandit-ridden, undead-roaming, demon-infested oyster.<br><br>We've put together a set of starting equipment with the money you've earned thus far, but any other gear you fancy you'll need to buy."
Message_End_Quest_Story_7C_10,"Choose your team, gear 'em up and you're ready to go. Good luck, guildmaster!"
Message_End_Quest_Story_7C_11,Multiplayer is now enabled.
Message_End_Quest_Story_7C_2,"The panel on the left is used to choose your party's line-up, and to customise their ability cards and items as you unlock more. You now also have free rein over which mercenaries to bring along on each mission, up to a maximum of four.<br><br>Be aware though, scenario difficulty scales with the number of mercenaries in your party. Unless you are a <b>Gloomhaven</b> veteran, I would recommend you stick with two characters for the time being to keep the decision making manageable!"
Message_End_Quest_Story_7C_3,"When equipping items, note that whoever equips an item first has it bound to them. You can unbind an item for a cost, but try to make sure you give it to the right mercenary the first time if you can."
Message_End_Quest_Story_7C_4,"To aid you in progressing your skills post-training, I have come up with a set of achievements for you to work towards. These can be accessed by the <b>Trainer</b> icon at the bottom of the screen. "
Message_End_Quest_Story_7C_5,"Completing these will reward the Guild with more gold, quests, and locations to discover. Sometimes even missions to recover powerful relics!"
Message_End_Quest_Story_7C_6,"You can pop by my shop by clicking the Merchant icon at the bottom of the screen. I've got mostly basic items in stock right now, but as you keep exploring and restore the routes to more villages, more and more items will be added to my stock!"
Message_End_Quest_Story_7C_7,"Speaking of which, could you journey down to the southwestern coast and open up the old spice routes?"
Message_End_Quest_Story_7C_8,I've had links with two towns there in the past: Bloodford to the West...
Message_End_Quest_Story_7C_9,...and Wayfarer's Rest to the South West.
Message_End_Quest_Story_BanditCommander_1,"With the Bandit Commander dead, the temples and the Demonsgate nest are now safe."
Message_End_Quest_Story_BanditCommander_2,"Well, it’s good to see the back of him, and that ring you got looks pretty useful."
Message_End_Quest_Story_BeastTyrant_1_1,"This Rot is worse than we first thought, it is spreading over the whole land."
Message_End_Quest_Story_BeastTyrant_1_2,The Beast Tyrant now wants us to investigate another outbreak in the Eastern forest near The Hermitage.
Message_End_Quest_Story_BeastTyrant_2_1,I’ve talked in depth with the Beast Tyrant and triangulated the spread of the Rot.
Message_End_Quest_Story_BeastTyrant_2_2,"As we had originally surmised, it seems to spread via freshwater that originates from the mountains to the south, near Obsidian Bluff."
Message_End_Quest_Story_BeastTyrant_2_3,But there is also a second tributary in the area of Rockfall further to the East.
Message_End_Quest_Story_BeastTyrant_2_4,We believe that is where the Deep Terrors are primarily breeding and is where we must head next.
Message_End_Quest_Story_BeastTyrant_3_1,"I’ve investigated further into the cave, and found an immature specimen which I believe is what ultimately becomes a Deep Terror."
Message_End_Quest_Story_BeastTyrant_3_2,"I’ll research further, but I believe I may be able to develop a potion to allow us to confuse the Rot into thinking we are an ally."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Berserker_1_1,"I looked for something to sell after you left, but only found one of the bandits’ journals. Apparently the Overseer is heading to Ironwood Camp to start an army. I say we head there next — they might have something I can stock. "
Message_End_Quest_Story_Berserker_2_1,"Can you believe a place called Ironwood has no Iron or wood to take and sell? I did poke around in the ledgers though, it looks like these wagons were heading to a cave outside Drake Fire Farm. Sounds like we will be heading there too, then."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Berserker_3_1,"So, I took a look at what you grabbed. Don’t worry, not even I would try to sell it back to you after what you went through to get it."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Berserker_3_2,"Anyway, it turns out you stole the map for the entire cave system… and we’ve found a way to sneak you in through a side entrance..."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Berserker_3_3,...But it’s got a pretty hefty lock on it. We’re stuck until we find a way to open it.<br>
Message_End_Quest_Story_Brute_1_1,"I’ll return to my trade camp near the Copper Oasis and see if any others of my clan have heard any rumours. Come visit me when you are ready, and I’ll tell you what I have found out."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Brute_2_1,"The traitor didn’t even lead his troops into battle, no wonder their morale broke. He isn’t much of a commander!"
Message_End_Quest_Story_Brute_2_2,"We’ve located both his main mustering ground, but also some ruins nearby where he has troops performing strange rites. It's probably worth raiding the ruins first and seeing what he is up to."
Message_End_Quest_Story_CaptainOfTheGuard_1,"We’ve reviewed the information you passed to us, and investigated the warehouse. "
Message_End_Quest_Story_CaptainOfTheGuard_2,"Unfortunately, the captain’s influence ran deep, and a good amount of our employees have been arrested. I don’t think we would have found the true extent of this without you. You have the City Guard’s apologies, and our gratitude."
Message_End_Quest_Story_CaptainOfTheGuard_3,"To think I looked up to the captain, all while he was hunting down anything that wasn’t human... I feel sick…"
Message_End_Quest_Story_CaptainOfTheGuard_4,Perfect timing! The Plagueherald and I have distilled the final curing spell into a Major Cure potion. The magic really is fascinating; I might even travel to the hive to learn more...
Message_End_Quest_Story_CaptainOfTheGuard_5,"Uh, see, I actually convinced the Plagueherald to give me the exclusive rights to the potion. You’ll have to buy it from me if you want some, old friend. No hives needed."
Message_End_Quest_Story_CaptainOfTheGuard_6,"No, I think I’ll just… *retch*"
Message_End_Quest_Story_CaptainOfTheGuard_7,So… this must be what karma feels like. I’ll go clean up. 
Message_End_Quest_Story_Cragheart_1_1,"The Shrine of the Roots is found in the forest near Lowtown. If they are being systematically looted, I worry that would be a prime target."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Cragheart_2_1,These are some highly organised Looters.... there must be someone in charge of all this planning. We need to find out who and make an example of them.
Message_End_Quest_Story_Cragheart_2_2,"For now, however, we should check out the last of the three temples: the Shrine of Verglas, near River’s Rise"
Message_End_Quest_Story_Cragheart_3_1,"The three core shrines are now safe. Only the mythical Shrine of the Ashes remains, but no one knows of its location."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Cragheart_3_2,"Well, if we don’t know of it, nor will the looters!"
Message_End_Quest_Story_DarkRider_1,"Well, that was quite a ride, wasn’t it?"
Message_End_Quest_Story_DarkRider_2,"Okay, I’ll let you have that one, this time."
Message_End_Quest_Story_DarkRider_3,You’re being… uncharacteristically nice. Are you feeling okay?
Message_End_Quest_Story_DarkRider_4,"I also found this helmet next to the Rider’s empty armour. I’m not really sure where it came from, given the whole ‘headless’ situation, but I’ll sell it to you at half the price I was planning!"
Message_End_Quest_Story_DarkRider_5,"Interesting. It seems that “Dark Rider” was the source of much of the evil in our realm. By winning its deal and shutting it out, its wickedness can no longer exist here."
Message_End_Quest_Story_DarkRider_6,Huh. Maybe I will have to look into that gardening firm then – it sounds like honest money...
Message_End_Quest_Story_DarkRider_7,"Uh, right. In the meantime, I’ll go back to securing contracts for killing something simple, like living skeletons with three arms. Someone’s got to be ready for the next interplanar menace we’ve somehow angered..."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Doomstalker_1_1,The blood trail led to a merchant’s caravan on its way back to Demonsgate. That caravan often supplies meat to a butcher’s shop in the Crooked Bazaar.
Message_End_Quest_Story_Doomstalker_1_2,"That’s an awfully long way to carry raw meat for a shop, isn’t it?"
Message_End_Quest_Story_Doomstalker_1_3,"I don’t think they’ve stolen an Orchid’s livestock just to sell spoiled meat, even somewhere like the Crooked Bazaar."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Doomstalker_1_4,"You don’t think the butcher’s shop is a real store, do you? Good. Fronts are one of my favourite crimes to... er, bust, of course."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Doomstalker_1_5,"Well, they would be one of your favourites, wouldn't they?"
Message_End_Quest_Story_Doomstalker_1_6,What’s that meant to mean?
Message_End_Quest_Story_Doomstalker_2_1,Even this ledger smells like it's made of rancid meat!
Message_End_Quest_Story_Doomstalker_2_2,"Well, it is full of rotten crimes…"
Message_End_Quest_Story_Doomstalker_2_3,Don’t do that. Don’t try to make the jokes.
Message_End_Quest_Story_Doomstalker_2_4,"Right. Well, the ledger says that all that gold was tipped to the merchant for ‘a job well done’, and I happen to know the merchant’s address it lists is actually a mercenary hideout."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Doomstalker_2_5,We may have our killers. Let’s go and make some mercenary mince-meat.
Message_End_Quest_Story_Doomstalker_2_6,<sigh>
Message_End_Quest_Story_Doomstalker_3_1,I’ve finished studying the paperwork you brought back. It seems these mercenaries were simply paid to wipe out the Doomstalker’s settlement. 
Message_End_Quest_Story_Doomstalker_3_2,"I can’t find any concrete links to an employer, or even a reason, but they aren’t the only ones — the paperwork says other mercenaries were hired to attack Orchids... "
Message_End_Quest_Story_Doomstalker_3_3,And I traced the sigil you found. It’s the logo of an abandoned warehouse in the Old Financial district. No one’s seen it on crates in decades. 
Message_End_Quest_Story_Doomstalker_3_4,But we shouldn’t go there yet. That warehouse is cut off from any functioning part of Demonsgate. We’d have no back-up if we burst in there alone.
Message_End_Quest_Story_Doomstalker_3_5,"And without knowing the people, reasons, or the Savvas’ part in the attacks,  I’d say it’s too risky. I’ll feed back to the Captain of the Guard for now."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Elementalist_1_1,"The Elementalist searches the ruined structures and finds some old scrolls from the mayor’s office. It seems after Swagger’s defence of the village, the settlement ended up in huge debt."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Elementalist_1_2,"The payments are addressed to a tower located near to modern-day Silverwick, in the mountains to the East. It looks like we should head there next."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Elementalist_2_1,"The library contains many musty tomes on all forms of magic, although almost all have since been disproved as poorly-researched, and are now only useful as kindling."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Elementalist_2_2,"There is one book of Swagger’s handwritten notes. It both details the payments from Mudchute, and talks of the ‘power of the gods’ given at an ancient temple, accompanied by a crude map."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Elementalist_2_3,"Looking at this paperwork, it looks as if the Bandits were in Swagger’s pay all along, and that he bankrupted Mudchute to get enough gold to donate at this temple."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Elementalist_2_4,The map looks like the edge of the forest up near the School of the Great Oak. Can’t have changed much in a hundred years.
Message_End_Quest_Story_Elementalist_2_5,"Right, we know where to head next then!"
Message_End_Quest_Story_Elementalist_3_1,"This temple held a portal to the demonic realm. Swagger must have passed through to gain his powers, and returned to our realm through a different portal."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Elementalist_3_2,But he never came back did he? Otherwise he’d have laid waste to the land?
Message_End_Quest_Story_Elementalist_3_3,"It seems not. Also, we found some strange symbols etched onto the wall next to the portal. They almost look like musical notes?"
Message_End_Quest_Story_HighCultist_1,"We did a sweep of the area after you left, and mopped up a few more Cultists. We found this incense burner too, which I reckon will come in pretty useful!"
Message_End_Quest_Story_HighCultist_2,"Also, it feels as though the elements are in balance again, now that the High Cultist is dead. Good work."
Message_End_Quest_Story_InoxBodyguard_1,"I doubt that’ll be the last Inox Leader we’ll ever see, but the Brute is finally avenged."
Message_End_Quest_Story_InoxBodyguard_2,I hope any other ones carry more of these awesome axes!
Message_End_Quest_Story_Jekserah_1,"The Summoner tells me that according to Jekserah’s notes, the book we recovered contains a powerful spell written just for the sanctuary we cleared."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Jekserah_2,Jekserah knew the Summoner would be interested in it. It seems she had us do her dirty work for her...
Message_End_Quest_Story_Jekserah_3,"When cast in the sanctuary, the spell would be amplified until it could raise and control all of Gloomhaven’s dead. It’s fascinating magic — which I will guard."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Jekserah_4,"Jekserah’s ring, however, isn’t guarded by the Enchantress — and seems to harbour potent magic. I would keep it... but it stinks of Undead. Think of it as a reward?"
Message_End_Quest_Story_MercilessOverseer_1,"So, I spoke to Vermlings after you left. They owe us for what we did, after all."
Message_End_Quest_Story_MercilessOverseer_2,"They don’t have much to give, being slaves, but one gave me an Ancient Drill as an attempt at thanks... well, they didn’t kill us for our flesh either, I suppose."
Message_End_Quest_Story_MercilessOverseer_3,"Anyway, the drill will do. It’s too old to have any value though, so I can guess you can just have it. A freebie."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Mindthief_1_1,"With your family scattered into the sewers around Demonsgate, you tell them to head to Lowtown, where you will catch up with them later."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Mindthief_2_1,You return the supplies to your makeshift nest. The young are especially pleased to have something substantial to eat.
Message_End_Quest_Story_Mindthief_2_2,"You realise however, that this location is temporary. You must plan to return to your own nest, and drive those who took it away."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Nightshroud_1_1,The Nightshroud has taken away the ectoplasm and has started doing some research in the basement of the Guild.
Message_End_Quest_Story_Nightshroud_1_2,I wondered what that smell was.
Message_End_Quest_Story_Nightshroud_1_3,"He’s now come to me with a mission to recover some Harrower Essence from Hound Hill, I’ll put it on the map."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Nightshroud_2_1,"Most of the Harrowers dissipated after death, but the Nightshroud managed to bottle some insectile remnants."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Nightshroud_2_2, Do we know ‘why’ he is doing this?
Message_End_Quest_Story_Nightshroud_2_3,"It’s something to do with a Rot affecting the land, next he wants to take down some Lurkers in Crystal Hollow."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Nightshroud_3_1,"The Nightshroud has started his experiment with the creature’s remains, he hopes it will give us an insight into the origin of the Rot."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Nightshroud_3_2," I hope so too, as then I can move back into the Guild when the terrible smells have gone.<br>"
Message_End_Quest_Story_Nightshroud_3_3,"Staying above the tavern is costing me a fortune, and I seem to be spending more time drinking!"
Message_End_Quest_Story_Plagueherald_1_1,I can’t believe we just saved a Harrower hive. Why would we do that?
Message_End_Quest_Story_Plagueherald_1_2,"Well, we fight to protect Demonsgate and her continent, and these peaceful Harrowers do live here. The Captain of The Guard even agreed to watch other known Harrower hives after the attack."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Plagueherald_1_3,"No, we fight to get rich. Whatever and whoever we save is whoever pays us, and Harrowers can’t pay. "
Message_End_Quest_Story_Plagueherald_1_4,"Actually, the Plagueherald said that its hive directed it to another hive living inside an old temple, which may have the knowledge it needs to complete its cure — and we are going to go there with it."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Plagueherald_1_5,"And before you ask, the temple is full of lost treasure that the hive no longer wants. "
Message_End_Quest_Story_Plagueherald_1_6,...Fine. I’ll go. But I am keeping all the treasure I find. 
Message_End_Quest_Story_Plagueherald_2_1,"So let me get this straight. The Plagueherald learnt what happened at the hive by EATING DEAD BUGS, and then just got on with its research?"
Message_End_Quest_Story_Plagueherald_2_2,"Not quite. Harrowers are clouds of sentient insects. When the Plagueherald joined its cloud with the dying hive insects, they were able to communicate."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Plagueherald_2_3,Okay… ew. I’m sorry I asked. Did we get what it needed at least?
Message_End_Quest_Story_Plagueherald_2_4," Yes, the Plagueherald says it’s now close to completing the spell. The information in that book is extraordinary! "
Message_End_Quest_Story_Plagueherald_2_5,"The Plagueherald also said that the Savvas and humans cleared the hive and set up traps together, but then the humans attacked the Savvas once they were alone."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Plagueherald_2_6,Hmm... Nothing about the mercenaries’ sigil though? Maybe some drunkard at The Sloshed Squirrel might know something. It’s the last lead I have left. 
Message_End_Quest_Story_Plagueherald_3_1," By the looks of things, someone paid these secret mercenaries well to destroy Harrower Hives all over Demonsgate and beyond."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Plagueherald_3_2,"Weirdly, it’s not just Harrowers. Valrath, Savvas, Inox and Quatryl are also mentioned as both hired mercenaries and targets. We’ve told the Captain of The Guard."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Plagueherald_3_3,He’s invited us to discuss the matter at an Old Financial District warehouse the City Guard has recently started investigating.
Message_End_Quest_Story_Plagueherald_3_4,"But given the infiltration of the City Guard, I think we should learn more about these mercenaries before visiting an isolated warehouse potentially full of their agents. "
Message_End_Quest_Story_Quartermaster_1_1,"I’m not sure how Living Corpses got into a Vermling nest, but at least we can investigate the Demonsgate Vault now."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Quartermaster_1_2,Why can’t you ever take me anywhere nice?
Message_End_Quest_Story_Quartermaster_1_3,I’ve also informed Demonsgate of the custodian’s death. I suspect they’ll have words with the Lowtown garrison.
Message_End_Quest_Story_Quartermaster_2_1,"I’ve studied the green substance you retrieved from the Vault. It’s only found at Kailej, inside a cave the locals believe to be hexed."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Quartermaster_2_2,"First an empty ancient vault, now a cursed cave…"
Message_End_Quest_Story_Quartermaster_2_3,"You know these are the places we are paid to enter, right?"
Message_End_Quest_Story_Quartermaster_2_4,Doesn’t mean I have to like it.
Message_End_Quest_Story_Quartermaster_3_1,The forest you discovered fits an old Inox myth of a hidden sanctuary which strengthens all those inside it. It’s a groundbreaking academic discovery.
Message_End_Quest_Story_Quartermaster_3_2,"The artifact is similarly intriguing. It’s a hemisphere, with a strange design engraved on it, alongside a sentence in an old Valrath dialect."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Quartermaster_3_3,"It reads: ‘Your demise opens like necks, but with the start of joy. Come forth, have your body join my employ.’"
Message_End_Quest_Story_Quartermaster_3_4,"Neither me or the Quartermaster know a thing about it. We’ll need to solve this before we get pa— er, before we find the stockpile. It likely leads to our thief."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Sawbones_1_1,"After having the Enchantress magically remove as much blood as she could, I had a look at the Cultist’s book. Turns out it was a journal."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Sawbones_1_2,"Oh what, did she curse the town in heartbroken rage because her ex was from Demonspire Hollow?"
Message_End_Quest_Story_Sawbones_1_3,"Close. One of the local cobblers ruined her favourite boots, actually. But the local curse was just a side effect. If the journal is to be believed, this ritual was a strengthening spell, directed at something more sinister taking place within Blackrock Asylum."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Sawbones_1_4,"Great. So we save the village, and end up going straight to prison anyway..."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Sawbones_2_1,"Well, that was odd. Ritual suicide by mercenary definitely isn’t someting we’ve seen before. <br>"
Message_End_Quest_Story_Sawbones_2_2,"There’s more. According to the Inox’s letter, the Red Talons invited his tribe to help them complete this ritual to level the Saltmarsh Flats, in an effort to cripple the healing magic of Demonsgate."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Sawbones_2_3,"Wait, isn’t that the School of the Great Oak’s whole deal? Why target the Saltmarsh Flats?"
Message_End_Quest_Story_Sawbones_2_4,"The Saltmarsh Flats is home to the School’s best healers, including your Sawbones. Our healers even secretly keep all of their ancient texts in the village hall, in case of an accident at the School. "
Message_End_Quest_Story_Sawbones_2_5,"Well, things just got serious quickly. We should protect the city. "
Message_End_Quest_Story_Scoundrel_1_1,I’ve heard that South Shield has put a bounty on the head of a big ol’ Inox who’s been leading attacks on the village. He might be your guy. I’ll mark it on your map.
Message_End_Quest_Story_Scoundrel_2_1,"You know what, that looks like the forest up near Eaglecrest. I’d bet my favourite hat on it. Probably best to get up there and ask around: they’ll know if any Inox are in the area."
Message_End_Quest_Story_SightlessEye_1,"With the Eye dead, we have reports that most areas of Rot are receding, but there could still be pockets of it around the land."
Message_End_Quest_Story_SightlessEye_2,"...What happened, what was that smell?"
Message_End_Quest_Story_SightlessEye_3,You passed out.
Message_End_Quest_Story_SightlessEye_4,Probably the smartest thing I’ve ever done...
Message_End_Quest_Story_SightlessEye_5,"...Look. I have a Fueled Falchion I use as a nightlight, and I want you to have it. For free. If you ever fight something that smelly again, kill it. With fire. From the Falchion. "
Message_End_Quest_Story_Soothsinger_1_1,"You talk to the remaining Bandits, but none of them have any explanation as to why the camp was attacked by Undead."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Soothsinger_1_2,Perhaps it was on an old Inox Burial Ground?
Message_End_Quest_Story_Soothsinger_1_3,"The good news is that the Soothsinger got some new bawdy tunes. I suggest we visit some Vermlings to learn some insults next, I know just the place!"
Message_End_Quest_Story_Soothsinger_2_1,What is going on? It seems someone doesn’t want us to learn new songs?
Message_End_Quest_Story_Soothsinger_2_2,"I think it is more serious than that, but it does seem related to the Soothsinger in some way."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Soothsinger_2_3,"In that case, we need to pre-empt the next attack, I’ll talk to some of my Inox friends and prepare a welcome party."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Soothsinger_3_1,"It took me a little while, but we got him to talk, you aren’t going to believe this…"
Message_End_Quest_Story_Soothsinger_3_2,Apparently he is working for some kind of skeletal champion who has a grudge against our Soothsinger.
Message_End_Quest_Story_Soothsinger_3_3,She is the descendant of a bard who sealed him in a tower to the north of Summerwell
Message_End_Quest_Story_Soothsinger_3_4,"But there is no way into the tower, it has a magical lock on it"
Message_End_Quest_Story_Spellweaver_1_1,"That Bandit’s dressed in the gear of the Emerald Knaves, from up near Eastgrove. I’d check out their base of operations next."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Spellweaver_2_1,"After hearing of your predicament, the Keeper of the Oak offers some words of advice."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Spellweaver_2_2,"In our Library at the Temple, there are writings of a shrine where you may ask for a boon in times of crisis. I feel this is one of those times."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Spellweaver_2_3,"I’ll mark the known location on the map, but usually you must prove your worth before it is granted."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Spellweaver_2_4,Simply say ‘I Require A Boon’ and all will be revealed.
Message_End_Quest_Story_Spellweaver_3_1,What did she get then?
Message_End_Quest_Story_Spellweaver_3_2,"We do not know, but it will reveal itself when needed."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Spellweaver_3_3,"Well, that's not vague at all is it? Couldn’t it just have given us a big flaming sword or something?"
Message_End_Quest_Story_Summoner_1_1,"The Summoner wanted more time in there, but she reckons she saw enough to know how to disconnect the realms now."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Summoner_1_2,She used my personal spellbooks to work it out. The Summoner says it cites another spellbook we’ll need — a tome lost to an abandoned library outside Mudview.
Message_End_Quest_Story_Summoner_1_3,Sounds like the perfect business opportunity! I might even tag along.
Message_End_Quest_Story_Summoner_2_1,"I’ve just had quite the talk with the Summoner. The book you reclaimed isn’t needed to close the rift. It just ‘sounded interesting’, and she fancied a read."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Summoner_2_2,"She almost killed us for a lost spellbook she doesn’t even need? ...We can sell it, right?"
Message_End_Quest_Story_Summoner_2_3,"On the contrary. She still needs the book, just not for the rift. The Summoner now has a safer way for you all to travel back into that dungeon..."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Summoner_3_1,"This hemisphere you’ve brought me, neither I nor the Summoner can find how it relates to the interplanar rift."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Summoner_3_2,"It has some kind of drawing carved in on the side, alongside an inscription written in a rare, old Valrath tongue."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Summoner_3_3,"The inscription roughly reads: ‘It ends a Seraph, without the beginning of pride. And see all who oppose the new queen subside.’ Curious."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Sunkeeper_1_1,"Now the Sunkeeper has earned their trust, they say that City Guards came to their camp and wanted to take some of them away."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Sunkeeper_1_2,They resisted and the Guards attacked!
Message_End_Quest_Story_Sunkeeper_1_3,"Although they were unable to stop the Guards from kidnapping some of their tribe, they have tracked them to this location near Mudview."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Sunkeeper_2_1,"Well, that map points clearly to Mistfell copse."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Sunkeeper_2_2,We should have these slavers taken down by tea-time.
Message_End_Quest_Story_Sunkeeper_3_1,It seems the Sunkeeper grabbed a key from around the neck of a Harrower Corpse.
Message_End_Quest_Story_Sunkeeper_3_2,"If we can find the actual base of operations, we’ll have a way in!"
Message_End_Quest_Story_Tinkerer_1_1,"These scrolls refer to a temple in the forest far to the north west, past even the School of the Great Oak. It looks as if that is the next area to investigate."
Message_End_Quest_Story_Tinkerer_2_1,"The documentation you have discovered will allow you to perform some rituals of your own. You decide to do this under the Guild itself, in case anything goes wrong!"
Message_End_Quest_Story_Tinkerer_3_1,"When your sight returns, the Demon has gone, returned to its own realm. You think this whole experiment was a mistake, when you smell burning…"
Message_End_Quest_Story_Tinkerer_3_2,"A map on the wall has a small hole burned through it, a spot just outside the location of ‘The Dome’. You wonder if the Sun Demon was trying to tell you something..."
Message_End_Quest_Story_UndeadCommander_1,It seems that Melody has tracked Swagger to the same temple we did and then employed a number of priests to create a spell of binding that only a bard could unlock.
Message_End_Quest_Story_UndeadCommander_2,"We may not have got much else from this quest, but I did find this er… Skull on the floor."
Message_End_Quest_Story_UndeadCommander_3,"Not even I can sell this, so here you go, it gives me the creeps."
Message_End_Quest_Story_WingedHorror_1,I think that was the most horrifying demon we’ve ever defeated. My ears will have nightmares for years.
Message_End_Quest_Story_WingedHorror_2,"On another good note, the School and its Great Oak are safe. The Sawbones is already helping the staff, students and records get moved back in.<br>"
Message_End_Quest_Story_WingedHorror_3,"The City Guard also recovered more of the Red Talons’ documents. It appears the Winged Horror is only summoned by rituals involving extreme suffering, and they take almost a decade to fully complete. We’ll have to be vigilant.<br>"
Message_End_Quest_Story_WingedHorror_4,"As for the Horror’s vomit, that solid lump was one of the power cores for the School’s defenses. It’s not a tome on construction magic, but it’s something.<br>"
Message_End_Quest_Story_WingedHorror_5,"What a whole lot of use that power core was... but you don’t look a gift-demon in the mouth, I guess. I’ve put it into storage for you: we’ll get more use out of the core than the School."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Amberhill_1,"So the City Guard are killing people now? That’s definitely not the kind of protection I pay my taxes for — though I do, er, definitely pay my taxes."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Amberhill_2,"Luckily, Amberhill is known for their enchanted wearables, made with a local magical Amber tree. "
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Amberhill_3,They’ve given me a lovely pair of Boots of Speed to help us on our way. Visit my store when you can!
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Bloodford_1,"Glad you made it through okay. The trade route is already back in action, and I should have some Stun Powder in stock when you return."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Bloodford_2,"We should get other trade route requests in now, so let’s keep expanding the network. Before you start... go have a bath, for everyone’s sake..."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_CrystalHollow_1,I’ve always imagined the riches I would find inside the Crystal Hollow.. the cave of legends!
Message_End_Quest_Travel_CrystalHollow_2,"It wasn’t great. Most of it was just mushrooms, and not even the magic kind."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_CrystalHollow_3,"But, a fight with a spider led me to fall o— er, discover a half-buried halberd. It seems pretty hefty, and it’s in my store."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_DemonspineHollow_1,"I always thought tales of Imps were a load of cobblers, but apparently that’s what Demonspine Hollow is known for. Cobblers that is, not Imps, Come have a look at the new Boots in stock."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_DrakeFireFarm_1,The farmers of Drake Fire Farm have taken the spores of some of the strange plants nearby and made some powder bombs.
Message_End_Quest_Travel_DrakeFireFarm_2,"I’ve not tried them myself, but they seem… unpleasant. I’m sure you’ll love them."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Eaglecrest_1,"I received a parcel from Eaglecrest today, from one of the Tinkerer shops there. Apparently a group of Inox paid to ship us a Telescopic Sight."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Eaglecrest_2,"I don’t know if that is a thank you gift, or a withering statement on your martial prowess?"
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Eastgrove_1,"Did you know that Eastgrove used to have a detachment of ancient Royal Guard? I didn’t either, but I now have a set of Platemail in the store for you!"
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Fordingbridge_1,"Boneshatter Pass to the South East used to be the home to the greatest shoemakers in the area, but it seems Fordingbridge learned some of their craft as a stopping point on the way."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Fordingbridge_2,I’ve got an interesting pair of shoes in stock now.
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Hammerholm_1,The blacksmiths of Hammerholm were overjoyed with your work. I have some new armour in stock!
Message_End_Quest_Travel_HoundHill_1,"The townspeople are just overjoyed that you drove those disgusting Harrowers out, and gave me a Falcon Figurine."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_HoundHill_2,"You’d expect a Hound Figurine, right? Well, apparently falcons are spiritual or something. Anyway, It’s in the store."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Ironbell_1,"I popped into Ironbell after you left to find a weapon of my own. I’m not going to join you on the front line, but I, er, wanted to feel part of the action."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Ironbell_2,"When I told one of the blacksmiths this, she looked at me... and then gave me these Steel Sabatons."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Ironbell_3,"I’ll take the hint. If you could use them, they’re in my store."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_IronwoodCamp_1,"The Ironwood Company are overjoyed with your work, and have sent me through the design for a new shield. Come check it out when you get a chance!"
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Kailej_1,I took a trip to Kailej after you left. I figured a warrior tribe must have some pretty valuable weapons. 
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Kailej_2,"When I asked the blacksmith for the kind of weapon she thought I’d use, she handed me a pretty ring. That hurt, I’ll admit"
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Kailej_3,"I didn’t think it did anything until someone tried to accost me later that night, and I ran away faster than usual… so if you don’t want it, I’ll probably wear it myself."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Keyport_1,"So, it seems like the city of Keyport is very much in our debt."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Keyport_2,I visited the town hall after you left to see how they plan to compensate us… and could you believe they weren’t going to pay us? They just muttered something about ‘eternal gratitude’
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Keyport_3,"Well, I pointed out a rather nice axe on their wall. Apparently it's important to the city’s history, but seeing as we saved the city, it’s now in my store. Take a look when you can."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_LowTown_1,"Lowtown isn’t exactly the height of sophistication, I’m afraid. I couldn’t find anything to add to the shop’s inventory."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_LowTown_2,"I don’t know what you mean, these Hooked Chains would be great in a fight. Use them to drag your enemies within melee range, then Thwack!"
Message_End_Quest_Travel_LowTown_3,They were just holding some crates of potatoes together..
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Millpond_1,"An old man who used to live in Millpond heard about us trying to save his hometown, and gifted us his traditional Millpondian Reaping Scythe which he used to harvest crops with."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Millpond_2,"Who knows, maybe you’ll find a use for it? It’s in my store."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Mudview_1,"Boy, am I glad I stayed inside the walls of Amberhill."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Mudview_2,"Anyway, I managed to barter for the Harrower’s cloak after you left."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Mudview_3,"It smells weird and there might be an insect or two left, but it seems to have a lot of storage space."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Nasitra_1,"Nasitra is known for its beautiful jewellery, so I’ve sourced some magical Moon Earrings you might find helpful."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_NomadCamp_1,"I had a walk about the camp after you left — thankful people are often the most generous, after all."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_NomadCamp_2,"One of the survivors offered me a ring as a way of thanks, which I gladly put on..."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_NomadCamp_3,"I tried to punch them in response, without even realising! I’m fairly sure the ring made me do it."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_NomadCamp_4,"Needless to say, I won’t be seeking out those nomads again. I’d appreciate it if you’d buy the ring before something worse happens."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_ObsidianBluff_1,You should thank me. I travelled all the way to that dungeon and braved its corridors to find something to se— to help you in our quest.
Message_End_Quest_Travel_ObsidianBluff_2,"There wasn’t much beside blood and eldritch squiggles, but I did find another ring. I was happy to leave with just that."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_ObsidianBluff_3,"But, of course, I walked straight into a room with a stray Black Imp. I wished I hadn’t, and suddenly I was back in the corridor again."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_ObsidianBluff_4,"I have a mind to keep the ring, but it’s in my store as a token of my generosity… buy it before I change my mind!"
Message_End_Quest_Travel_RiversRise_1,"Some villagers scouted out the deeper rooms of the temple after you left, and have got me a few powerful healing potions. They should certainly help."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Rockfall_1,The Demons attacked from the South. The only destination in that direction is the old tower called Spitepeak.
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Rockfall_2,It seems that is where the Savvas’ base will be found.
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Rockfall_3,"The Savvas have given me a charm, which they say may help you in the fight against their brethren."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Sahmyrt_1,"Ah thank goodness, with the spice route back open, my food can actually start to have some flavour again!"
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Sahmyrt_2,I’ve also been able to get some important ingredients to start supplying Major Stamina Potions. Many warriors value these really highly!
Message_End_Quest_Travel_SaltmarshFlats_1,"I couldn’t wait to get into Saltmarsh Flats. I mean, a village of magicians? There was bound to be some amazing things in there!"
Message_End_Quest_Travel_SaltmarshFlats_2,Their shop was full of ancient relics and powerful items… I was just about to take a flaming sword when the owner saw me trying to blow it out so I could hide it.
Message_End_Quest_Travel_SaltmarshFlats_3,"I grabbed some boots with ‘quick’ on their label instead, put them on, and used them to escape fast."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_SaltmarshFlats_4,"They’re now in the store, and I suggest you buy them. I’m not going back for anything else."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_SchoolOfTheGreatOak_1,Advocates from the temple have supplied me with an old helmet that guards from a previous order used to wear.
Message_End_Quest_Travel_SchoolOfTheGreatOak_2,"I’m not sure why a group of healers would need to instill fear in their subjects, then again, I’ve never really understood religion as a rule."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_ScurvyBay_1,"Normally I try to steer clear of criminals, but I decided to see what these bandits had on offer — for you, of course."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_ScurvyBay_2,They just threw this Volatile Bomb at me. I’m still not quite sure whether it was a gift or a threat.
Message_End_Quest_Travel_ScurvyBay_3,"Either way, it hasn’t exploded… yet. It’s in my store, but I suggest you hurry up."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Shaderest_1,"I’ve done a deal with a local trinket maker to make some interesting Talismans. Come and have a look, you might find them useful?"
Message_End_Quest_Travel_ShadowfieldManor_1,"I received a package by courier this morning and it had a pretty piece of jewellery in it. However, every time I look at it it turns my stomach. Probably means you’ll find a use for it!"
Message_End_Quest_Travel_ShimmeringShallows_1,I popped into town and met a friendly old fisherwife after you left.
Message_End_Quest_Travel_ShimmeringShallows_2,"Turns out, the town is in love with fishing, and she is in love with, er, me. I just about escaped with my clothes on... and a Long Spear."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_ShimmeringShallows_3,Come have a look at my store if you think you could use it.
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Silverwick_1,"You head away from the burned copse, and the journey to Silverwick passes without any more trouble."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Silverwick_2,"Silverwick’s trade route is open once again, and the thankful villagers have given me a smart-looking helmet for you to try out."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Silverwick_3,"I’ve been contacted by a considerable amount of villagers from Rockfall, a Savvas community to the East."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Silverwick_4,"They are concerned that the recent occurrences are due to a group of rogue magic users who left their community for Wayward, and think that we should head there next."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_SouthShield_1,"This is it! We’ve got to the southwestern tip of the realm, and I now have access to the armourers that give South Shield its name."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Spitepeak_1,This should ensure peace returns to the land.
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Spitepeak_2,Maybe for a whole day if we are lucky!
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Spitepeak_3,I popped into the tower after you left and picked up an interesting staff that someone left behind. Perhaps you can find a use for it?
Message_End_Quest_Travel_StaybrightFort_1,"Staybright Fort is very big and old, so I thought I’d nip in to see what treasures its basement hides."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_StaybrightFort_2,"Turns out, the damn thing is full of unstable explosives. Just… why?!"
Message_End_Quest_Travel_StaybrightFort_3,"I managed to get some out safely. I don’t know what you’ll do with it, but I’d encourage you to buy it before it explodes."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Summerwell_1,"After resting in the cave and continuing to Summerwell, the weather was a lot milder."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Summerwell_2,"The villagers are overjoyed that the cold snap they had experienced is over. Although, their vineyards are ruined..."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Summerwell_3,One of the villagers sent me an ornate dagger as a thank you. You might find it useful?
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Summerwell_4,"Apparently, the Savvas have left for an ancient Savvas Temple in an extinct volcano in the mountains. We should head there next."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Sweetwater_1,"Fortunately Sweetwater isn’t all sewer, so I had a poke around once the villagers had scrubbed the town down."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Sweetwater_2,"I managed to find a solid helmet in a bush. It stunk worse than a Cultist’s table, but I couldn’t pass it up."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Sweetwater_3,"Apparently it had an owner, but she slipped on some stray sewage chasing me, so I guess it's a lucky helmet. It’s in my store when you get a chance."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_TempleOfTheAcorn_1,Thank you for cleansing the temple of those vile Hounds! Our followers will soon return and get the site functional again.
Message_End_Quest_Travel_TempleOfTheAcorn_2,"As a token of our thanks, we will supply your merchant with our powerful healing potions."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_TheBarrenCoast_1,"We are now linked with the coastal traders, which means I have some access to items from across the sea. Something you might be interested in is a cool winged Helm, come have a look!"
Message_End_Quest_Travel_TheBuriedTrenches_1,"Ruins from an ancient civilisation, just freed of monsters? Of course I went back after you left, and you better be glad I did."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_TheBuriedTrenches_2,"I spotted a pair of greaves near the reservoir, and pulled them out of some questionable goo."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_TheBuriedTrenches_3,"They are MUCH heavier than they look, but are still in decent condition. Heavy means useful… right? Take a look when you can."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_TheCityOfSlate_1,"The first item dug up from the city was an amulet with healing properties, it’s now in stock. Have you ever wondered why so many corpses have a healing potion in their pockets...?"
Message_End_Quest_Travel_TheCopperOasis_1,"Some local Inox tribesman are supplying me with some of their weighted nets, perhaps you might find a use for them in combat… The nets that is, not the tribesmen."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_TheDome_1,It seems the historians have found a stash of unpleasant ritualistic knives used by the Cultists. I’m sure they’ll come in handy for someone like you...
Message_End_Quest_Travel_TheEnclave_1,"The Mayor said that one of his dogs had a strange amulet around its neck, and wondered if it might help you work out what happened."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_TheEnclave_2,"I’ve never seen it’s like before, but it seems to have some magical properties, so you might have a use for it?"
Message_End_Quest_Travel_TheHermitage_1,"He was rather apologetic, and has promised not to dabble in reanimation again, so I convinced him to change his line of research to alchemy instead .The good news is that he’s already started to supply me with a source of more powerful Mana Potions!"
Message_End_Quest_Travel_TheHole_1,"The Temple indicates two elemental focal sites in the surrounding areas, where the ancient Savvas set up altars to control the weather."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_TheHole_2,"It is likely you will find the Savvas at these locations, as well as where they are collecting their crystals from."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_TheHole_3,We should head to these locations and disable the altars. I’ve marked the locations on your map.
Message_End_Quest_Travel_TheHole_4,One of the archaeologists was so happy for the weather to have changed that she sent me an ancient shield she excavated last year. It looks to be in pretty good condition!
Message_End_Quest_Travel_ThePyre_1,"It seems that defiling the undead’s resting place was the cause of the haunting, and now they have been re-laid to rest. Military forces have left a small retinue guarding the keep again."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_ThePyre_2,The good news for us is that I know a Quartermaster who can get us a supply of Chainmail... just don’t tell his commander!
Message_End_Quest_Travel_TheShiftingSands_1,"I couldn’t resist the allure of a digsite full of rare and ancient artifacts. There was a lot more there than they told you, you know."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_TheShiftingSands_2,"I came across a very striking cloak, but I floated into the air as I put it on. It took me two hours to get down… and now I’m even scared of getting up on a horse!"
Message_End_Quest_Travel_TheShiftingSands_3,"You’ll never catch me dead in that cloak again, but I’m sure it has its uses. It’s in my store — just be careful putting it on."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_TheSloshedSquirrel_1,"The landlord was pretty happy when you arrived. Apparently the guests had run out of money, and had run up an almighty tab!"
Message_End_Quest_Travel_TheSloshedSquirrel_2,"He’s supplied me with some of his special stuff from the basement. It helps you hit harder, if you can remember what it is you are supposed to be hitting!"
Message_End_Quest_Travel_TheThorngate_1,"After talking to the villagers, it seems some of the children had entered the cave and stolen some magical artifacts the week before. This was a form of revenge."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_TheThorngate_2,"And so in retaliation, you’ve just gone in and killed all the Imps? Seems a little harsh..."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_TheThorngate_3,"So, err, let’s move on... I’ve now got some new boots in stock!"
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Toadmoor_1,"You inform the mayor of your findings and he is overjoyed, inviting you for a hearty feast in his manor."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Toadmoor_2,"For a town as dull as Toadmoor, I’m surprised at the workmanship on the jewellery they’ve sent me. I reckon it’s magic too."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_WayfarersRest_1,"I’ve managed to do a deal with one of the local Merchants to get in a stock of Minor Mana Potions, so hit me up for one when you have some spare gold!"
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Wayward_1,"Apparently, Wayward has had problems with localized storms for a few weeks now. They're glad that you have found out the cause."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Wayward_2,"It’s not the safest town in the land, but that’s probably why they make pretty good sets of Studded Leather Armor! Come check out my shop for a set."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Wayward_3,"I’ve asked around, and apparently, a group of Savvas did come into town."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Wayward_4,"They spent time visiting the Savvas Enclave in Wayward, but were quickly dismissed when they mentioned their plans."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Wayward_5,"I've been told that they then headed east to Summerwell, with a few extra stragglers in tow."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Wildspire_1,"I hoped that the town would reward us with some powerful weapons, but it seems they make fashionable jewelry for more alternative types."
Message_End_Quest_Travel_Wildspire_2,"That said, this earring does seem to have some magical properties."
Message_End_Travel_BlackrockAsylum_1,"As the Armoury was badly damaged, the Asylum passed me one of their bigger weapons."
Message_End_Travel_BlackrockAsylum_2,"Although why an Asylum needs a massive sword like this, I probably don’t want to know."
Message_End_Travel_BoneshatterPass_1,The monks of Boneshatter Pass are overjoyed that the path has been cleared and have given me some of their fabulous footwear!
Message_End_Travel_MistfellCopse_1,One of the villagers from Mistfell Copse gave me an ancestral blade as a token of thanks. Take a look when you can!
Message_Rewards_Quest_Story_4A_1,"Ah, the joyous sound of gold coins in the pocket! But what to invest it in? Perhaps I should get some <nobr><b><font=""MarcellusAlt SDF""><color=#F8F8F8>Minor Mana Potion</color></font></b></nobr>s back in stock..."
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_BanditCommander_1,"The boxes recovered from the Mindthief’s nest contain some of the artifacts looted from the three Savvas shrines, but also from a fourth location."
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_BanditCommander_2,"Look, this sigil here is clearly from the Shrine of Ashes. They have found it!"
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_BanditCommander_3,That crate has markings from a shipping company out of Wildspire. I’d bet my hat the shrine is nearby!
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_BanditCommander_4,But you don’t appear to be wearing a hat?
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_BanditCommander_5,My Ma told me to never make a bet I couldn’t afford to lose!
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_CaptainOfTheGuard_1,"So, looks like we have human mercenary groups across Demonsgate attacking other races, and at least one of them has infiltrated the guard. Great."
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_CaptainOfTheGuard_2,"Hang on… wasn’t one group paid by crates from an Old Financial District warehouse, and didn’t the Captain of The Guard want to meet at a warehouse there? "
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_CaptainOfTheGuard_3,You’re right — and I dug into it a little further. The crates' sigil matches the sigil of the Old District warehouse the City Guard purchased. Looks like things go much deeper than we thought.
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_CaptainOfTheGuard_4,I say we prepare for a trap and confront the Captain of The Guard about this at the warehouse. Bring your best gear — we must assume he’s behind all of this. 
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_CaptainOfTheGuard_5,"If you plan on bringing your best gear, you had better plan on coming back with it..."
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_CaptainOfTheGuard_6,One last thing. The Plagueherald reckons it’s perfected a first dose of its cure-all. It would like to try it on you before you leave.
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_CaptainOfTheGuard_7,"Well, better you than me. That thing is not coming near me! "
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_DarkRider_1,"I was thinking, after the amount of evil plots we’ve foiled in and around Demonsgate, our mercenaries might actually have finished their training."
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_DarkRider_2,"Ironic, seeing as there’s been no new contracts for a while now. It’s like we’ve emptied Demonsgate of its evil. Maybe I’ll rebrand us as a gardening company to keep the money com– "
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_DarkRider_3,A violent tremor shakes the Guild hall.
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_DarkRider_4,What was that? Where did that draft come from? What happened to the lamps?<br>
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_DarkRider_5,Hmm… did you forget to pay the oil and firewood bills again?
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_DarkRider_6,What? No! The gold coins I gave the city are the best fakes I’ve ever produ–
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_DarkRider_7,Enough games! You and your mercenaries will fall!
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_DarkRider_8,That voice is in here with us! How did it get in?
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_DarkRider_9,"Well, it looks like we have our next contract at least... "
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_HighCultist_1,"Now the Spellweaver has the ‘boon’, whatever that is, we should plan the assault on the Cult headquarters."
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_HighCultist_2,But how do we know where it is?
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_HighCultist_3,The Sun Demon could have been trying to communicate. Perhaps where it burnt the map?
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_HighCultist_4,"To the North of Bloodford, in the swamps? I guess that’s where we go then?"
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_InoxBodyguard_1,You now have both the location of the Traitor’s base and the means to get into it. Prepare yourself for a fight!
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_Jekserah_1,Has anyone tried maybe… slotting the two hemi-thingies together? Into a sphere?
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_Jekserah_2,Intriguing… They fit together perfectly. The inscription has interlocked:
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_Jekserah_3,"‘Your demise opens as a neck, but with the start of joy. It ends a Seraph, without the beginning of pride. Come forth, have your body join my employ, And see all who oppose the new queen subside.’"
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_Jekserah_4,"Those drawings… they form a map! It leads to the Sewers of Demonsgate. Whatever that riddle means, I’m sure our thief and Demon conjurer will be there. Let’s go."
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_MercilessOverseer_1,Where was that side entrance on the cave plan again?
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_MercilessOverseer_2,"It opens out into a holding area, near the cave’s main chamber."
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_MercilessOverseer_3,Is there any chance that it could be a holding area for newly-kidnapped Vermlings?
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_MercilessOverseer_4,Maybe… Do you think the Sunkeeper’s key may be for that door?
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_MercilessOverseer_5,"It’s worth a try, isn’t it?"
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_SightlessEye_1,"The Nightshroud’s research is complete, he’s told me the origin of the rot will be the creature at its centre."
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_SightlessEye_2,That would be south near Obsidian Bluff then?
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_SightlessEye_3,"He also believes that these creatures partly communicate through excretions, and that it’s nest will only be revealed if we are able to replicate them."
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_SightlessEye_4,I don’t think I’ve ever heard anything so disgusting…
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_SightlessEye_5,"The Potion I have created from the Deep Terrors may help us here, we should head to Obsidian Bluff."
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_UndeadCommander_1,"You know what, this angry skeletal chap sounds a lot like a certain hero that the Elementalist has been researching"
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_UndeadCommander_2,"Swagger? So he did come back from the demonic realm, but then got trapped in Cursekeep?"
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_UndeadCommander_3,"Hmm, sounds best if we head that way and investigate?"
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_WingedHorror_1,"The Harrowers and Inox seemingly worked together at the Saltmarsh Flats. Without that village’s healing resources, the School will struggle to stop the Harrowers spreading endless disease as the Inox reclaim their homeland from humanity. "
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_WingedHorror_2,"The School’s dealt with worse. It’s still standing, right? With our help, I’m sure it’ll manage to overcome whatever death and disease the Inox and Harrowers create."
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_WingedHorror_3,Bring your Guild’s mercenaries quickly! A flying demonic beast is attacking The School of The Great Oak! 
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_WingedHorror_4,"Wait... the School IS still standing, right?!"
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_WingedHorror_5,"Yes, but it can’t take much more. Hurry – without it, no healers will be left to stop the Red Talons eradicating humanity from Demonsgate with death and disease."
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_WingedHorror_6,That demon I saw at the Saltmarsh Flats – they must have needed the village’s dying magic to summon this winged “Horror” so it can slaughter Demonsgate’s remaining healers!
Message_Start_Quest_Boss_WingedHorror_7,"Well, it looks like we have no choice but to save the School. We better still get paid though."
Message_Start_Quest_Travel_Keyport_1,"Right, time to take the battle to Keyport."
Message_Start_Quest_Travel_Keyport_2,We'll send a small force by land while our allies go in via ship from the rear.
Message_Start_Quest_Travel_Mudview_1,"There are too many troops to the north, we'll have to get help from elsewhere."
Message_Start_Quest_Travel_Mudview_2,"I suggest contacting the Mayor of Mudview, she's always had a wise head on her shoulders."
Message_Start_Quest_Travel_Rockfall_1,"With both temples out of action, the Savvas should now be vulnerable to an assault... if we could find out where their base is."
Message_Start_Quest_Travel_Rockfall_2,"Hold on, I’ve just got a missive from Rockfall. They are under attack!"
Message_Start_Quest_Travel_Rockfall_3,"Then the Savvas must be nearby, using their own abilities rather than the crystals."
Message_Start_Quest_Travel_ShimmeringShallows_1,"We've got the troops and the weapons, but how do we get them to Keyport?"
Message_Start_Quest_Travel_ShimmeringShallows_2,"A ground attack would be crazy, we need to get them in via sea."
Message_Start_Quest_Travel_ShimmeringShallows_3,"Let's take the port at Shimmering Shallows, the Council won't expect that!"

PERSONALQUEST_A_Helping_Hand_COMPLETED,"No other feeling compares to this warmth that spreads throughout your entire body when you see someone reach the goal they had been striving for, and finally relax. Watching that change in people never gets old. But the world is big, with Gloomhaven being just a small part of it — there are plenty more people that need help to reach their dreams, and you’re the one to do it. You say your goodbyes, and as you head back out onto the road in search of struggling souls, you can’t help hoping that someone else will continue giving people here a reason to sing, dance and celebrate."

PERSONALQUEST_Vengeance_PROGRESS_COMPLETED_STEP_0,"You had found it next to a dead bandit in the battle’s aftermath, the small — and overfilled — coin purse addressed to the very person your growing amount of evidence has been pointing to. The label’s reverse side simply read “bribe” in messy handwriting, and bore a local bandit clan’s sigil. This was the last piece of the puzzle you needed to confirm your suspicions: you are now certain of who allowed your friend to die, and you are going to get your answers one way or another. "

PERSONALQUEST_Zealot_of_the_Blood_God_COMPLETED,"Sacrifice was demanded and so sacrifice was given, but now your service is complete. The blood god has shown you that there is no more use for you in their plans; you are to find your own way now. You respect your god’s wishes, of course, but you can’t help feeling betrayed at how little your devotion seemed to mean. As you leave the city, you decide you’ll live a peaceful life from now on — maybe even buy a farm. Whatever happens, the blood god will have to find a new zealot to play with in Gloomhaven."

QUEST_JOB_CallOfTheWild_INTRO,"As civilisation advances, it often collides with nature, and sometimes those collisions leave lots of people dead.

There have always been rumours of a demonic rift from hundreds of years ago, but no demons have ever been seen locally. However, the rumours talk of a barrow out of town. You head to the location, and the barrow is easy enough to find: there are cracks in its surface, and a lot of fallen soil. You dig through the soil, find an ancient opening, and squeeze inside.

Smoke rolls out from the hallway as you open the door, and carries the faint sound of incomprehensible mantras. On your guard, you continue into the dungeon until the chanting is deafening, and the heat inside crushing. Looking into the next room, you feel your eyes deceive you. Cultists recite unholy words in the room’s centre, but around them is every manner of flaming monster.

QUEST_RELIC_AncientDrill_Unlock_4,And walk straight into whatever killed him?
QUEST_RELIC_CuriousGear_Complete_1,I think this hasn’t ended up so bad after all. The gear in the chest should allow us to easily disarm more traps in the future.
QUEST_RELIC_CuriousGear_Unlock_1,"I’ve noticed that a vast percentage of the traps you’ve disarmed in most of these missions are primarily an Inox bear trap design, and use wood local to part of the Eastern forest."
QUEST_RELIC_CuriousGear_Unlock_2,"They are a bit of a nuisance really. Perhaps we should go and visit the tribe that makes them, and convince them to stop their manufacture."
QUEST_RELIC_CuriousGear_Unlock_3,"I think I know the tribe you mean, I have a contact there. I’ll get him to arrange a meeting."
QUEST_RELIC_DoomedCompass_Unlock_1,"I’ve been told of an abandoned Lighthouse near Sahmyrt, that whenever a ship gets near it, the helmsman steers into nearby reefs."

QUEST_RELIC_DrakescaleArmor_Unlock_2,I’ve been trying to research any relic that might help you out and I think i’ve tracked down a set of Armor that could help out.
QUEST_RELIC_DrakescaleArmor_Unlock_3,The drawback is that it is located in a not-quite-extinct volcano.
QUEST_RELIC_DrakescaleBoots_Complete_1,"Why is it when we grab a relic, I look back on the mission we just completed and think ‘well, that would have been useful'?"
QUEST_RELIC_DrakescaleBoots_Unlock_1,With all the Demons in the land it’s been getting a lot more difficult to get around.
QUEST_RELIC_DrakescaleBoots_Unlock_2,I’ve heard that a group of Inox living out near Ironbell have crafted some boots which are resistant to terrain effects.
QUEST_RELIC_DrakescaleBoots_Unlock_3,Would it be the same group of Inox that murder anyone who comes near their encampment or in fact anyone within 50 miles?
QUEST_RELIC_DrakescaleBoots_Unlock_4,...Maybe... I’m sure the villagers of Ironbell would be happy to see the end of them.
QUEST_RELIC_DrakescaleHelm_Complete_1,"Well, he was certainly happen to get his chest back, even if the contents were a little soggy."
QUEST_RELIC_DrakescaleHelm_Complete_2,"He was as good as his word though, this Helmet is of high quality!"
QUEST_RELIC_DrakescaleHelm_Unlock_1,"I’ve been noticing that your mercs seem to be getting Muddled a lot in combat, so I sent some feelers out to see if anyone had anything that might help."
QUEST_RELIC_DrakescaleHelm_Unlock_2,"An Inox Trader in Kailej told me he had a rare helmet in stock made out of Drakescale, but the price, well, it made my eyes water."
QUEST_RELIC_DrakescaleHelm_Unlock_3,"However, he sent me a missive today, saying his shop had been raided by Bandits who took off into the sewers."

QUEST_RELIC_EnduranceFootwraps_Complete_1,The Abbot was overjoyed that the Savvas had been driven from the vicinity.
QUEST_RELIC_EnduranceFootwraps_Complete_2,"He’s let us keep the footwear we found. To be honest, they look a little flimsy for mountain hiking anyway!"
QUEST_RELIC_EnduranceFootwraps_Unlock_1,"We’ve got a number of pretty spritely characters in our Guild now, perhaps we should revisit the Monks of Boneshatter Pass."
QUEST_RELIC_EnduranceFootwraps_Unlock_2,"They do have a good selection of boots, maybe we can do a quest for them?"
QUEST_RELIC_FleaBittenShawl_Complete_1,"Let me get this straight… You ventured into a sewer, fought oozes, and all you got was this lousy cape."
QUEST_RELIC_FleaBittenShawl_Complete_2,"And by lousy, I literally mean covered with lice! Why would anyone go near this thing?"
QUEST_RELIC_FleaBittenShawl_Complete_3,"I think we can use this to our advantage, this should also keep enemies away too."
QUEST_RELIC_FleaBittenShawl_Unlock_1,I’ve noticed that a number of the Elite Vermlings you have faced sometimes have rags containing a weak magical residue.
QUEST_RELIC_FleaBittenShawl_Unlock_2,"By studying them, I’ve identified that they come primarily from a large midden to the North East of Scurvy Bay."
QUEST_RELIC_FleaBittenShawl_Unlock_3,A midden? You mean a rubbish dump?
QUEST_RELIC_FleaBittenShawl_Unlock_4,"Well, yes, that is another term for it. Anyway, I suggest you visit the area and see if there is anything useful to be found."
QUEST_RELIC_FleaBittenShawl_Unlock_5,I think I’ll stay home for this one!
QUEST_RELIC_NecklaceOfTeeth_Complete_1,"I looked through the pile of detritus in that chest, I guess you could call some of it ‘Jewelry’."
QUEST_RELIC_NecklaceOfTeeth_Complete_2,I don’t think anyone will be wearing much of it at a ball though.
QUEST_RELIC_NecklaceOfTeeth_Complete_3,"Surprisingly, there is a necklace that seems to have magical properties, I’d wear it under your clothing so no one sees it though!"
QUEST_RELIC_NecklaceOfTeeth_Unlock_1,We have been murdering our way across the land for quite a while now.
QUEST_RELIC_NecklaceOfTeeth_Unlock_2,"When you are paid for it, it isn’t murder, it’s a job."
QUEST_RELIC_NecklaceOfTeeth_Unlock_3,"Right, anyway, I’ve got a lead on a relic that could help us, a rumour of an evil witch in the woods who fashions her victims into jewelry."
QUEST_RELIC_NecklaceOfTeeth_Unlock_4,Sounds wonderful.
QUEST_RELIC_OrbOfDawn_Unlock_1,"Right, we’ve killed enough of these blasted Sun Demons to get an understanding of what makes them tick."
QUEST_RELIC_OrbOfDawn_Unlock_2,It also seems that their power is drawn from a number of ancient temples dotted around the realm.
QUEST_RELIC_OrbOfDawn_Unlock_3,One of which has previously been unearthed near River’s Rise. We believe there is a secret room deeper in the structure where the artifact sits. You must venture into the heart of the sun to retrieve it.
QUEST_RELIC_OrbOfTwilight_Unlock_1,Is there an infinite number of those spindly things? Surely they have to be coming from somewhere?
QUEST_RELIC_OrbOfTwilight_Unlock_2,"Some sages from our School have identified a cursed crypt, near one of the original outbreaks, that could hold a relic which may help in our fight."
QUEST_RELIC_OrbOfTwilight_Unlock_3,"It is no surprise that the first Night Demons were seen around Drake Fire Farm, as it appears the dungeon is deep in the forest."
QUEST_RELIC_RemoteSpider_Complete_1,That seems to be some sort of clockwork spider that poisons your enemies? Why does everything have to be so unpleasant... couldn’t they have made a cute cat or a squirrel?
QUEST_RELIC_RemoteSpider_Unlock_1,"You've used a lot of Poison now, so I have been trying to find an item you’d get a lot of use out of with your expertise."
QUEST_RELIC_RemoteSpider_Unlock_2,"One of the Brute’s old Allies said he can help. Scabwit, tell them what you told me."
QUEST_RELIC_RemoteSpider_Unlock_3,I know of a group of feral Vermlings who live with snakes... dirty creatures. They have been trying to take an old Tinkerer device and imbue it with snake poison.
QUEST_RELIC_RemoteSpider_Unlock_4,"Unfortunately, they have been trying it out on some of my tribe members. If you help me track them down, you can have the item."
QUEST_RELIC_RingOfSkulls_Complete_1,This ring has powerful properties. It should help us in many battles to come.
QUEST_RELIC_RingOfSkulls_Complete_2,Is it just me who is wondering who the poor skeleton trapped inside it used to be?
QUEST_RELIC_RingOfSkulls_Unlock_1,"Now that you have destroyed so many summoned Living Bones, we have identified one of the ways that the Cultists are summoning them."
QUEST_RELIC_RingOfSkulls_Unlock_2,"Many of the Cultists wear magical rings attuned to their life force, and we have located an area where they are created."
QUEST_RELIC_RingOfSkulls_Unlock_3,Head here and you may be able to find a ring of your own.
QUEST_RELIC_SacrificialRobes_Complete_1,"So, this cloak, I mean is it ‘made’ of an ex-Bandit? It certainly smells like it is."
QUEST_RELIC_SacrificialRobes_Complete_2,"Best not to think about that... Also, be careful when using it. It seems to not exactly do a great job of protecting the wearer, but then I assume the Cultists didn’t really care about that!"
QUEST_RELIC_SacrificialRobes_Unlock_1,"It looks like you’ve been using Ranged attacks pretty effectively, and I’ve tracked down the location of a relic that might help you be even stronger."
QUEST_RELIC_SacrificialRobes_Unlock_2,"I’ve heard that a group of Cultists have been recruiting Bandit Archers, and are trying to magically enhance clothing to improve their Ranged attacks."
QUEST_RELIC_SacrificialRobes_Unlock_3,"Certainly sounds like it is worth checking out, I’ll mark it on your map."
QUEST_RELIC_SecondSkin_Complete_1,"Well, that was unpleasant…"
QUEST_RELIC_SecondSkin_Complete_2,The Valrath is happy to get his prototype back and has already managed to replicate his initial design.
QUEST_RELIC_SecondSkin_Complete_3,Which we will be keeping?
QUEST_RELIC_SecondSkin_Complete_4,"I think after the lack of Harrower and Stone Golem mentions, that should cover our payment, yes."
QUEST_RELIC_SecondSkin_Unlock_1,We’ve been in a lot of scrapes together and I’ve noticed our mercs are quite often overburdened in combat.
QUEST_RELIC_SecondSkin_Unlock_2,"I’ve had a call from a Valrath armourer who has invented a new close fitting cuirass, but he says his business partner stole the prototype."
QUEST_RELIC_SecondSkin_Unlock_3,"He then fled to Scurvy Bay with his associates, so you’ll need to go there to recover it."
QUEST_RELIC_StaffOfElements_Complete_1,"Although it seems obvious to give this Staff to your most powerful magic user, it can often be advantageous to give it to another character to empower an Element before that character’s turn. Choose Wisely."
QUEST_RELIC_StaffOfElements_Unlock_1,"Your Elemental abilities have improved dramatically since you started this Guild, and I believe you are now ready to attempt the Trial of the Elements."
QUEST_RELIC_StaffOfElements_Unlock_2,"This is no simple mission however, the Trial takes place in a cave in the mountains containing a wide variety of extremely dangerous Demons."
QUEST_RELIC_StaffOfElements_Unlock_3,"Of course, you are wondering what you will gain from completing the Trial? The Staff of Elements, a powerful magical artifact."
QUEST_RELIC_StaffOfSummoning_Unlock_1,You’ve been utilizing Summons pretty well over the last few quests and I think I’ve found the location of a relic that will help.
QUEST_RELIC_StaffOfSummoning_Unlock_2,One of the librarians at the School of the Great Oak has informed me of a Savvas Staff of Summoning although it will be guarded by powerful mages.
QUEST_RELIC_StaffOfSummoning_Unlock_3,"It can be found in the mountains near Rockfall, I’ll put the location on your map."
QUEST_RELIC_StaffOfXorn_Complete_1,"How do you pronounce Staff of Xorn then? X-orn, Zorn, Zzshorn? How about we call it ‘Head on a stick’?"
QUEST_RELIC_StaffOfXorn_Unlock_1,"Enemies are so much easier to deal with when they are already Poisoned or Muddled, aren’t they? It seems you aren’t the only one to have found that out."
QUEST_RELIC_StaffOfXorn_Unlock_2,A tribe of Inox near the Barren Coast have become a real problem lately. They have joined a sect trying to resurrect an ancient power called ‘Xorn’.
QUEST_RELIC_StaffOfXorn_Unlock_3,"It is rumoured they have a number of powerful staves which they use to defeat their enemies, and the tribe needs dealing with before it comes too powerful."
QUEST_RELIC_SteamArmor_Complete_1,"We explained that the Alchemist had been testing his armor against Stone Golems and Demons and that as he was nowhere to be seen, it likely hadn’t been too successful."
QUEST_RELIC_SteamArmor_Complete_2,The head warder said we could keep the Armor as payment.
QUEST_RELIC_SteamArmor_Complete_3,"Great, we get some broken armor?"
QUEST_RELIC_SteamArmor_Complete_4,"Well, I didn’t mention that he hadn’t actually been wearing it, it actually looks pretty powerful."
QUEST_RELIC_SteamArmor_Unlock_1,"I’ve received a communication from the Asylum at Blackrock, where one of their alchemists had been working on a new form of hi-tech armor."
QUEST_RELIC_SteamArmor_Unlock_2,"However, he was researching in his tower when there was a lot of noise, screaming, and then silence."
QUEST_RELIC_SteamArmor_Unlock_3,Let me guess… They want us to investigate?
QUEST_RELIC_SteamArmor_Unlock_4,Got it in one.
QUEST_RELIC_SteelRing_Complete_1,"As you burst out into the sunlight, you take a deep breath of fresh air. You are glad to be out of that accursed tomb!"
QUEST_RELIC_SteelRing_Complete_2,"That ring looks as if it’ll do a pretty good job of keeping you alive in a tough spot. I think the stress was worth it, good job!"
QUEST_RELIC_SteelRing_Unlock_1,"I can see you’ve learned to handle pain, and therefore I think you are ready to take on one of the more dangerous quests."
QUEST_RELIC_SteelRing_Unlock_2,"Hidden in a cursed catacomb beneath the City of Slate is a ring of protection that would aid us greatly in our quests, but beware."
QUEST_RELIC_SteelRing_Unlock_3,"Not only are there Cultists and Undead, but the tomb itself will sap your health. Remember to take extra healing!"
QUEST_STORY_Doomstalker_1_DESC,Someone tried to wipe out an entire settlement of Orchid. Track them down.<br>
QUEST_STORY_Doomstalker_1_INTRO,"During your journey, the Doomstalker explains how he and these other Orchid had crossed the Misty Sea to live in the lands around Demonsgate. He, along with those that now worked the land in the small settlement you were travelling to, reject the Orchid way of seeking enlightenment through meditation — instead seeking a deeper illumination through hard labour in an unforgiving land. When you arrive, the famous forges, fires and blacksmiths of South Shield feel much further away than they actually are among the simple Orchid huts and farmland. Meeting the hardy stares of the other villagers as you follow the Doomstalker, you could see a rugged, practical resolve in their eyes. He leads you into the chief Orchid’s hut, who proceeds to describe the attack to you. A few days ago, a small human force had charged the settlement unprovoked, but were clearly unprepared for the Orchids to be as strong as they were, even without their appointed Doomstalker there to protect them. You are about to ask what these humans looked like when an arrow sprouts from the wall beside the chief’s head. She needs only point at the bandits closing in on the shack’s door to show you the perpetrators...   "

QUEST_STORY_Doomstalker_2_INTRO,"Though the Captain of the Guard has now promised to investigate the business, the Doomstalker decides to carry on his own investigation. Helpfully, you can literally follow your nose through the Crooked Bazaar to the butchers’ store. As you walk through the grime-covered door, two Quatryl butchers are paying a merchant much more than they should for the rotten bodies of a few Orchid livestock. A dirty ledger sits atop the rancid meat counter between the merchant and the Quatryl, which both are writing in. The Doomstalker barges past the merchant, and tries to snatch the ledger. Immediately, everyone bolts. One Quatryl opens the door behind the counter to the shop’s back and escapes — but not before he slips and drops the ledger in the back room. The merchant and other Quatryl both dive through the store’s front window, and run away screaming about a robbery. Almost instantly, the City Guard rush in behind you, demanding that you stand down. Your only exit is in the back room, despite the borderline necrotic stench rolling out the doorway... "

You can’t help but cast your mind back to the Umbran League, but with any luck these mercenaries won’t have any interest in the arcane and unholy. A rectangular patch of dead grass sits outside the cave — likely where the mercenaries’ payment has been left before. As you move inside the cave, you begin to hear echoed shouts and thumps. The sounds of a battle. Drawing your weapons and advancing carefully, you spot a group of Savvas angrily banging on the dungeon’s door. “How dare you treat us like some pathetic lesser race!” one of them roars, before launching an ice bolt at the door. “We had a deal, and you will suffer for breaking it!” You decide now may not be the best time to storm the dungeon, but as you back away you catch a pebble with your foot. The Savvas all turn to face you. “More betrayers? Perish!” Together, they all bring their arms above their heads. You can feel heat and cold swell in the air, and the ground shakes beneath your feet as the sound of cracking rocks echoes around you.

The Elementalist, being a powerful magician, is keen to understand how Swagger was able to harness physical and mental powers, and so wants our help investigating the past. One of Swagger’s most famous heroic tasks was the protection of the village of Mudchute, which was located to the north west of Bloodford, so that is where you head.

The journey is long, but passes reasonably quietly, the chatter of small animals in the trees, and the wind blowing through the undergrowth the only sounds you hear.

Once inside the sewers, you are relieved to finally be out of the desert’s sand and heat. However, this relief is quickly washed away when you realise you are standing in a room covered floor to ceiling in insects and sewage, despite these sewers being abandoned. The Plagueherald’s humanoid form dissipates into a small cloud of its own insects, and as if on cue, the entire room becomes a cloud of legs and buzzing. After a few agonising minutes, the insects settle down again, and the Plagueherald reforms in front of you. “We must go,” it says, sounding like someone with a mouthful of angry bees. As you turn to leave the nightmarish room and face the desert once more, an arrow impales one of the insects on the floor in front of you, and the room rapidly clears of all insects save the Plagueherald.

You are much more surprised to find the door to this long-forgotten temple blown off of its hinges, and laying on the floor, still smoking. Weapons drawn, you enter the hive’s temple. A dark weight hangs over the silent air. As you walk further in, something crunches under your foot. Looking down, you see the floor is littered with the curled-up insects of dead Harrowers, interspersed with many Savvas and a few human bodies.

Getting the barman’s attention over the hubbub, you produce the sigil and hand it to him. The barman takes a long look, but eventually holds it out, shaking his head. Before you can take it back, a gloved hand snatches it.

You make your way to the village hall, which has since become a makeshift hospital. Inside, many of the townsfolk writhe in pain on rough beds. Some have their shoelaces tied together, and various grave wounds on their heads, while others are missing entire sections of their limbs, and are blaming their leather scissors. One villager even had two broken feet, strangled inside some impossibly tight-laced boots. You seek out the local doctor, who tells you that all these people were indeed seriously injured while working with shoes. “We’ve often heard chanting in the forest outside,” the doctor tells you. “I just assumed it was villagers praying for good luck.” Shaking your head at the elderly man, you ask for directions to the forest and ready your weapons.

One of the cultists notices you, and chuckles. “Will you be joining us, mercenaries?” The nuns let you into the cell, and close the door behind you. “It’s nice of you to visit your friends here, dear,” one of the nuns says to you as they leave. “We’ll be back soon to let you out.” As soon as the nuns are out of earshot, the cultists draw their weapons. “Welcome to the party,” one of them growls.

As the gates open and you enter, you find its magically-constructed huts somewhat underwhelming – but still standing. The village hall isn’t much more to look at, but as you travel deeper inside, the building seems to expand indefinitely into rooms full of bookshelves. “With you here,” a sudden, hoarse voice drones as a buzzing fills the air, “The Red Talons can finally begin our work.” Turning to the voice’s source, you see a Harrower Infester break into a grating chortle before dissipating into a cloud of fat insects.

Quest_Relic_DrakescaleArmor_DESC,This rare armour can be found in a crypt found on the slopes on the side of an active volcano!
Quest_Relic_DrakescaleArmor_INTRO,"The Armor you are going to collect was fashioned by a rather ingenious Tinkerer blacksmith. She reckoned that the best way to prevent the poison and wounds caused by Drakes was to create an armor out of their own scales. Her theories were sound, however, the major drawback was sourcing the materials for the armor as Drakes didn’t give away their scale willingly. Not being a great fighter herself, she lived in an isolated crypt up the side of a mountain where she bred Drakes. Unbeknownst to her, the mountain was a dormant volcano and when it erupted she was never heard from again. The Trainer has tracked down an approximate location of the crypt to the South West of The Hole. You leave the mine workings and immediately see the volcano in the distance. As you head closer, the acrid smell of sulphur assaults your nostrils and regular tremors shudder the ground beneath your feet. You find the ruined entrance to the crypt and head inside."

If anything, they are glad to see you. Though having guttural voices, you understand their dialect and they invite you to join them in their evening meal. You reach the central clearing where dinner is being prepared, and conversation turns to their magical boots. The Inox nod and indicate the chest where they are stored. You can take them tomorrow, they have no use for them. You explain that you do not need any food and are happy to pay, but the more you insist, the angrier they become. It’s at this point you notice the bones around the encampment, they are not animal bones but humanoid. You were invited for dinner, not as guests, but as the main course.

He greets you and guides you into the back of the shop. ‘They came up from the sewer’ he explains, pointing to a hole in the floorboards clearly sawn through from underneath.

If you head down now, you might be able to follow their trail!’. You take his advice and climb down into a rickety tunnel which looks to have been dug out by hand.

When you arrive, you find the old building overflowing with City Guard soldiers and equipment. All the guards watch you as you approach. Before long, the captain appears. “Thank you for meeting me all the way out here,” he says. “You’ve made my job of reclaiming Demonsgate for humanity much easier by allowing me to... ‘investigate’ your murder.”  Before you can get to him, the captain disappears back into the warehouse’s depths.

However, the cave’s rock appears to be patterned. Upon further inspection, you find it to be carved decoratively. As you venture inside, you find yourself within a surprisingly intricate cave system.

Quest_Story_Tinkerer_1_INTRO,"After visiting the Shadowfield Manor private library, the Tinkerer identified a location where Demons were first seen on the continent. A smallholding to the east was attacked by ‘creatures of the night which had come down from the hills’ centuries ago, so you head east to investigate. After some searching, you find the remains of an old well and some foundations of a farm building, and in the distance, the low hills that lead into the eastern mountain range. Heading further east, you spot an entrance to a cave high above, and you start the climb. Reaching the entrance, you don’t see anything that appears to indicate demons: just more wild animal bones. Nonetheless, you venture inside."

There have been rumours for centuries about explorers going missing, strange weather patterns in the area, and the sounds of explosions or mysterious lights up on the peak. In short, it has the name ‘Cursekeep’ for a good reason. With some trepidation you leave for the keep, but you know this is something that has to be resolved or the Soothsinger will be in permanent danger. After following an old paved road winding its way through the mountains, you come to the keep, a jagged tooth jutting up from the rock face. The drawbridge is up and there is no way you can see to bring it down. It’s at this point you try calling out some ‘passwords’.. ‘Swagger’, ‘Mudchute’, ‘Temple’, ‘Gods’, nothing obvious works. You exhale a collective sigh and as you turn to head back to Summerwell the Elementalist suggests the strange symbols you found near the portal. He draws them in the air and the Soothsinger plays them on her lute. Suddenly you hear grinding of stone behind you and the drawbridge falls open. It seems the quest is not yet over..."

Once you make it through the thick forest surrounding the arcane structure, you’re happy to find it still standing. Its ancient warding seems to be holding, for now. Many of the School’s scholars, students and books have already been moved outside, and are preparing to evacuate the School’s centuries of records from whatever the cultists have brought upon it. As you look around for a way to reach the Winged Horror, one of the School’s Elders approaches you. “The demons and Inox have taken over the school,” he laments. “They are defending the Horror as it tries to destroy the Great Oak, the centre of our faith.” Thanking the Elder, you make your way inside the School. Opening the door, you immediately lock eyes with a congregation of demons, black imps, and Inox. The Inox look straight at the Sawbones, and one steps forward. “Your time ruling this sacred homeland is over, human!” it shouts, before charging. All of its comrades follow suit.  "

You arrive at the asylum, and are greeted by a very stern looking nun, who explains that the goal of the asylum is to help the troubled among us back into society. In this case however, the lower floors had their more extreme patients, and she explains that it is very unlikely you will be able to bring them back safely: the armoury for the guards was also on the lower floor, and has been ransacked."

They shun all contact, but periodically come down the mountain to trade their fine footwear for food and other basic resources. The villagers from Silverwick have not seen them for months, and as there is a Savvas Temple in the area you decide to head up the small trail to their outpost to investigate. The path is rocky, and certainly has been affected by a number of rockfalls in recent times. You repair the path as you go, pushing large rocks to the side to allow passage.

While somewhat arid, the south is not devoid of life as some believe — many animals pass by you. You can see how Inox may live here, even if they did come from the north. When you arrive, you find Kailej’s dirt paths deserted in the dusk - save for the uncomfortably-smelling and nauseously-coloured substances left behind by the creatures following this Rot. You can see movement between the wooden planks of hut doors, so you go to investigate. As you reach out to knock on a door, a loud squelch comes from the crude drain next to you — it seems the Inox have built a sewer system.

Before you know it, Keyport has come into view. You sneak inside, and search for the artillery. The first emplacement is easy enough to spot, and you move toward it, eager to start your assault.

You can see more being brought along the road coming from Keyport. The artillery emplacements are especially formidable, so you decide on a hit and run tactic to target them. The best way to do this is to split up and sneak in from two directions at once, and there is a building either side of you leading deeper into the town. The group on the left head into an old tanner’s shop, which is fortunately empty.

Quest_Travel_ShimmeringShallows_INTRO,"The Trainer has directed you to Shimmering Shallows, as their seaport would provide an invaluable avenue of attack for your reinforcements in your major assault of Keyport. The journey over was exhausting, as the ground became increasingly wet and sandy until it was tugging at your boots. With the town in sight, you keep low, looking for the best place to burst in on the Militia garrison. Watching from the outskirts, you can barely make out the end of a speech from one of the Militia sergeants. ‘...and I will explain that now.

Quest_Travel_Silverwick_INTRO,"Several merchants from Demonsgate have asked for you to investigate why trade from Silverwick has ceased recently. As you leave Blackrock Asylum, you see evidence of Demon incursions everywhere: patches of burned land or crevices where the land has been torn asunder. Part way along the road you find a wagon laden with Silver Ore. Its sides are scorched and burned bodies lay around it. Clearly, this is why no more traders are getting through.

You almost immediately spot Spitepeak in the distance, a partly ruined tower once home to a number of powerful magic users, and seemingly home to them again. Rumours proliferate of magical traps and tricks that used to deter unfriendly visitors, and meant that the location wasn’t resettled after infighting between the mages blew the roof off the building.

Surveying Staybright Fort today, its history seems to be long forgotten. A Dark pall hangs low over the crumbling castle, making a mockery of its name. The walkways swarm with Militia soldiers and Harrowers, while Ancient Artillery shines between them. Storming the front gate would be suicide, so you look for another way in.

SCENARIO_JOB_1_1_UNDEAD_CRYPT_SUCCESS,"The undead are gone, but the smell remains. Fortunately, removing that isn’t part of the job. You leave the tomb and head back to claim your reward."
SCENARIO_JOB_AnEyeForAnEye_Start_1,The first room has a number of Cultists ‘converting’ bandits to undead. The smell is terrible.
SCENARIO_JOB_AnEyeForAnEye_Start_2,"I knew Cultists were vile, but this turns even my stomach. Time to die!"
SCENARIO_JOB_AnEyeForAnEye_Success_1,"As the last enemy dies, the Bandit Archer falls to her knees, exhausted."
SCENARIO_JOB_AnEyeForAnEye_Success_2,Thanks for your help... at least I got my vengeance. Here is your reward.
SCENARIO_JOB_CallOfTheWild_Start_1,"Entering the cave, you can still catch the scent of blood in the air as you pass down a corridor, the floor littered in half-eaten bones."
SCENARIO_JOB_CallOfTheWild_Start_2,The passageway opens out and you see a strange collection of creatures living in the same space. Perhaps they have all learned to live closer together due to the advances of the settlements in the area?

SCENARIO_JOB_DemonAltars_Start_1,"I hate Demons… so spidery… Thankfully, they do not naturally exist in our realm, and especially not in such numbers."
SCENARIO_JOB_DemonAltars_Start_2,There is something allowing them in – you’ll need to find it and destroy it to curb this infestation.

SCENARIO_JOB_SNAKES_UNDEAD_MAP_INTRO,"You accept the job to clear a crypt of Giant Snakes, which sounds like a routine job. When you meet the landowner who offered the job, he seems a little vague about the actual problem: yes, there are snakes, but he’s cagey about anything else down there.

SCENARIO_JOB_SavvasAid_Success_2,It seems the Savvas are discovering more and more of their history around Gloomhaven. We should expect to hear from more Savvas that require our services.
SCENARIO_JOB_SavvasInfighting_Start_1,"It appears these Savvas are fighting over which discipline is the most powerful, and are catching villages in the crossfire..."

SCENARIO_JOB_SavvasInfighting_Success_2,"These Savvas’ pursuit of power led them to fight each other without regard for those they deem inferior, and it seems many of them feel this way. I don’t think this will be the last group of warring Savvas you encounter."

SCENARIO_JOB_TheVaultsOfPus_Start_1,You enter the crypt and see Cultists hastily trying to raise an army of undead... but apparently the family buried here were of the larger persuasion.
SCENARIO_JOB_TheVaultsOfPus_Success_1,"The crypt is safe once more. Perhaps in future, the owners might put a stronger padlock on the door. One can only hope."
SCENARIO_JOB_TwoTribes_Start_1,You arrive to the sounds of pitched battle. The confrontation has already begun.
SCENARIO_JOB_TwoTribes_Start_2,"There are a lot of troops on both sides, and the fight is taking place on multiple fronts."

SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3B_02,"Firstly, you need to:<br><line-height=20%> <br></line-height>• Kill <b>3</b> <b>Archer</b>s this round before they attack<br><line-height=20%> <br></line-height>You'll certainly need something that can hit more than one <nobr><b><link=""Glossary_Target"">Target</link></b> <sprite name=Target></nobr> at a time!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3B_03,"The <b>Archer</b> hit you. The <b>Scoundrel</b> has some very low Initiative value ability cards, select one of those to act first."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3B_04,"Not quite, I need you to take out all three archers in the same round!

SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3B_05,"Ha! Feels good picking off multiple targets in a single turn, doesn’t it? One last objective: <br><line-height=20%> <br></line-height>• Loot at least 5 piles of gold this round<br><line-height=20%> <br></line-height>A tip for you — sometimes the top half of a card allows you to <b>Move</b> too!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3B_06,"<b><link=""Glossary_Loot"">Loot</link></b> abilities pick up <i>all</i> of the gold within the radius specified by the value, so you work out where you need to stand and get <b><link=""Glossary_Loot"">Loot</link></b>ing!"

SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3B_OBJ_02,Loot at least 5 tiles this round
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_4A_01,"Right, this is your first proper fight. Looks like two clearings with a couple of bandits each."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_4A_02,"Just remember what I’ve taught you, and don’t enter the second clearing until you are ready. You can change your characters' starting positions this time by clicking the white hexes, so choose a formation that suits you before starting your first turn."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_4A_03,"By the way, if you're struggling to make out objects and enemies in the undergrowth, you can press <b>Tab</b> to highlight them.<br><br>You can also see the turn order of monsters of the same class this way. They will all get the same <b>initiative</b> from the card drawn for their class, but the actual order per monster on that class' turn is determined by their ID numbers. Lower numbers act first!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5A_01,"Meet the <b>Spellweaver</b>, a powerful but fragile magic wielder who can harness the natural elements of the world. Good thing we found her when we did, that's a lot of bandits!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5A_02,"To get her out of this mess, you'll need to harness the power of the elements infused in the battlefield. The elemental infusions display can be seen on the right of the screen, indicating which magical elements available for consuming. In this scenario, the <b><link=""Glossary_Ice"">Ice</link></b> element is already infused, but elements are normally infused for two rounds through using actions with elemental symbols on them, available for consumption after the turn in which they are infused."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5A_03,"This round you must: <br><line-height=20%> <br></line-height>• Consume the <b><link=""Glossary_Ice"">Ice</link></b> element to augment <nobr><font=""MarcellusAlt SDF""><color=#F5E3B0><b>Freezing Nova</b></color></font>'s</nobr> <b><link=""Glossary_Attack"">Attack</link></b>, killing as many bandits as you can.<br>• Survive the round by using a <b>Jump Move</b> to get out of reach.<br><line-height=20%> <br></line-height>"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5A_04,"You need to <b><link=""Glossary_Jump"">Jump</link></b> away to safety from the bandits after hitting them with your Nova!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5A_05,"To power up <nobr><font=""MarcellusAlt SDF""><color=#F5E3B0><b>Freezing Nova</b></color></font></nobr> you need to consume the <b><link=""Glossary_Ice"">Ice</link></b> element before using it. Make sure you click on the <b><link=""Glossary_Ice"">Ice</link></b> symbol to toggle the consuming of the element before clicking elsewhere on the action to use it."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5A_06,"By consuming the Ice element, <nobr><b><font=""MarcellusAlt SDF""><color=#F5E3B0>Freezing Nova</color></font></b></nobr> dealt <b>3</b> base damage instead of <b>2</b>! Knocking out three bandits plus applying the <link=""Glossary_Immobilize""><b>Immobilize</b></link> condition so the bandits couldn’t chase after you is pretty darn powerful, eh?"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5A_07,"<nobr><font=""MarcellusAlt SDF""><color=#F5E3B0><b>Ride The Wind</b></color></font></nobr> also infused the <b><link=""Glossary_Air"">Air</link></b> element for you to use later if need be. <br><br>You may have also noticed, with only three unburnt cards remaining, the <b>Spellweaver</b> will be exhausted after the next round is over, as you cannot return burned cards via resting!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5A_08,"Fortunately, the <b>Spellweaver</b> has a very powerful trick up her sleeve. Many of her powerful cards may burn after usage, but the top half of <nobr><font=""MarcellusAlt SDF""><color=#F5E3B0><b>Reviving Ether</b></color></font></nobr> allows her to return <i>all</i> of her burned cards to her hand! Getting the timing right on this one-time recovery per scenario of all burned cards is key to using <b>Spellweaver</b> well."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5A_09,"It's up to you now: <br><line-height=20%> <br></line-height>• Kill the remaining <b>Bandit Guard</b>s!<br><line-height=20%> <br></line-height><nobr><font=""MarcellusAlt SDF""><color=#F5E3B0>Reviving Ether</color></font></nobr> will recover all of your burned cards, so you can finish these bandits off at your leisure!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5A_10,"For helping her out of that bind, the <b>Spellweaver</b> has agreed to join our Guild! As you saw, her abilities can be incredibly potent, but she can be a difficult character to work with due to the complexity of her tactics."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5A_11,"Have another go at using her abilities. Remember you consume infused elements to power up abilities, and don’t get caught in <b><link=""Glossary_Disadvantage"">Disadvantage</link></b> by using <b><link=""Glossary_Range"">Ranged</link></b> <b><link=""Glossary_Attack"">Attack</link></b>s on adjacent targets!"

SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5B_01,"Meet the <b>Tinkerer</b>! He’s a great support character to have on a team, but can also take on multiple enemies in a pinch. Looking at all those skeletons, I'd say this counts as one!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5B_02,"Currently he is <b><link=""Glossary_Wound"">Wound</link></b>ed <sprite name=Wound> and will take one damage at the start of his turns, so you ought to <link=""Glossary_Heal""><b>Heal</b></link> him as soon as possible with that <nobr><b><font=""MarcellusAlt SDF""><color=#F8F8F8>Minor Health Potion</color></font></b></nobr>."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5B_03,"Looking at where the enemies in this room are, I’d advise you go as late as possible this round. Sometimes it’s better to go slow and let the enemies come to you, so you aren't at risk of being attacked. Then you can use one of the <b>Tinkerer</b>’s famous <b>area effect</b> attacks to deal some serious damage to multiple enemies at once!<br><br>You can recognise such abilities by their hex-shaped patterns on the ability card, showing you the shape of the area it will target."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5B_04,"Remember to use your <b>item</b>s, you have more than just the ability cards at your disposal!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5B_05,"You didn't manage to hit three enemies.

SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5B_07,"Boom! <nobr><font=""MarcellusAlt SDF""><color=#F5E3B0>Ink Bomb</color></font></nobr> was pretty good, eh?"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5B_08,I’ll leave you to finish off the rest of these bad guys. Did you know you can rotate the shape of an Area Effect by pressing <b>R</b>? 
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5B_09,"Remember when enemies are nearby to try and go first, <nobr><font=""MarcellusAlt SDF""><color=#F5E3B0><b>Net Shooter</b></color></font></nobr> should help you to finish them off."

SCENARIO_PUZZLE_6A_01,"Hounds burst from the undergrowth, barking at you menacingly, soon followed by a Vermling Scout. He seems briefly taken aback at having stumbled upon a band of mercenaries, but quickly regains his composure and nocks an arrow, ready to fight."

SCENARIO_RELIC_OrbOfTwilight_Room_2_1,This area also has Stone Guardians. Avoid them if you can: you only need to kill the Night Demons and retrieve the Relic.
SCENARIO_RELIC_OrbOfTwilight_Room_3_1,"The Orb is there, retrieve it!"
SCENARIO_RELIC_OrbOfTwilight_SM1_DESC,At the Start of each round the Dark Element is set to Strong
SCENARIO_RELIC_OrbOfTwilight_Start_1,You’ll need to get inside and claim the artifact. Only then will the Night Demons' power be reduced in the area.
SCENARIO_RELIC_OrbOfTwilight_Start_2,"Beware, however, that it has created an almost permanent amount of Dark Energy. Use it to your advantage."
SCENARIO_RELIC_OrbOfTwilight_Success_1,"With the Orb in your hands, and the Night Demons killed, the aura of dark power leaves the dungeon."
SCENARIO_RELIC_OrbOfTwilight_Success_2,"Well done heroes, this area should now finally be clear of their blight."
SCENARIO_RELIC_OrbOfTwilight_Success_3,This relic should aid our fight against some of the brighter demons!
SCENARIO_RELIC_RemoteSpider_Room_4_1,It looks as if the item they have been using is in that chest over there.
SCENARIO_RELIC_RemoteSpider_SM1_DESC,Vermling Scouts have Poison added to their attacks
SCENARIO_RELIC_RemoteSpider_Start_1,"Look at them, living in a cave with Snakes. This is not how Vermlings should live!"
SCENARIO_RELIC_RemoteSpider_Start_2,"Beware the archers, they also have Poisoned arrows... Attack!"
SCENARIO_RELIC_RemoteSpider_Success_1,Well fought! These Vermling shall no longer be plaguing my tribe!
SCENARIO_RELIC_ResonantCrystal_Room_2_1,"It’s clear this room is being used as some kind of storage dump, and you can see a chest sitting on the floor. Time to grab the loot and silence anyone who stands in your way."
SCENARIO_RELIC_ResonantCrystal_Start_1,"Entering the tomb, you are greeted by the angry shouts of bandits."
SCENARIO_RELIC_ResonantCrystal_Start_2,"You ain’t getting this star stone, we found it, so Bugger off!"
SCENARIO_RELIC_ResonantCrystal_Start_3,"He turns to one of his accomplices and tells them to guard the back room. Well, now you know where it is being stored, smart guy..."
SCENARIO_RELIC_ResonantCrystal_Success_1,"The crystal throbs in your hands, it certainly contains some powerful magic. You stick it in your pack and head out."
SCENARIO_RELIC_RingOfSkulls_Room_3_1,That is where the Ring will be kept. Kill the rest of the enemies and grab the Ring before reinforcements arrive!
SCENARIO_RELIC_RingOfSkulls_SM1_DESC,Cultists have permanent Shield +1
SCENARIO_RELIC_RingOfSkulls_SM2_DESC,Cultists heal 1 Health at the end of each Round
SCENARIO_RELIC_RingOfSkulls_Start_1,"This is one of the Cult’s headquarters, so expect heavy resistance and powerful magic."
SCENARIO_RELIC_RingOfSkulls_Start_2,"Indeed, I detected that the Cultists have augmented themselves with some form of protective enhancements. They will be difficult to kill."
SCENARIO_RELIC_RingOfSkulls_Success_1,Regenerating Cultists... that’s something I hope to never see again!
SCENARIO_RELIC_SacrificialRobes_Room_2_1,"So, this is the grand idea? The Cultists sacrifice the Bandits, and then create clothing out of their remains? That is… disgusting!"
SCENARIO_RELIC_SacrificialRobes_Room_2_2,"And by the look of it, the Archers don’t get a lot of say in the matter!"
SCENARIO_RELIC_SacrificialRobes_Room_3_1,"Look over there, it appears that one of the items of clothing hasn’t been used yet. Let’s grab it."
SCENARIO_RELIC_SacrificialRobes_Room_3_2,For research of course.
SCENARIO_RELIC_SacrificialRobes_SM1_DESC,All characters add <nobr>+1 Attack <sprite name=Attack></nobr> to all ranged attacks
SCENARIO_RELIC_SacrificialRobes_Start_1,You’ll need to get inside to see what is going on. Something about this seems pretty fishy... why would Bandits and Cultists work together?
SCENARIO_RELIC_SacrificialRobes_Start_2,"I’ve just noticed, there seems to actually be a magical aura in the area meaning all Ranged attacks ARE more dangerous, what the...?"
SCENARIO_RELIC_SacrificialRobes_Success_1,"Great work, the cloak is ours!"
SCENARIO_RELIC_SecondSkin_Room_2_1,"Kill them, they must not escape!"
SCENARIO_RELIC_SecondSkin_Room_2_2,He neglected to mention his business partner was a Harrower!
SCENARIO_RELIC_SecondSkin_Room_2_3,"Too late to worry about that, grab the Armour and go out that back door!"
SCENARIO_RELIC_SecondSkin_Room_3_1,Blooming Stone Golems too?!
SCENARIO_RELIC_SecondSkin_Room_3_2,"Just keep moving, almost there!"
SCENARIO_RELIC_SecondSkin_SM1_DESC,All Bandits have <nobr>+1 Attack <sprite name=Attack></nobr>
SCENARIO_RELIC_SecondSkin_SM2_DESC,All Bandits have <nobr>+1 Shield <sprite name=Shield></nobr>
SCENARIO_RELIC_SecondSkin_Start_1,"You pass through a couple of rooms without incident, but entering the next room, the alarm is raised!"
SCENARIO_RELIC_SecondSkin_Start_2,"‘Ere, how did you get in? Intruders!"
SCENARIO_RELIC_SecondSkin_Start_3,"These Bandits seem better outfitted than most, best not try and kill them all, recover the Armour and get out!"
SCENARIO_RELIC_SecondSkin_Success_1,You escape with the Armour and your bodies intact.
SCENARIO_RELIC_StaffOfElements_SM1_DESC,At the start of each Round set ALL Elements to Strong
SCENARIO_RELIC_StaffOfElements_Start_1,"It is worse than I thought. Not only is the cave full of Demons, but a powerful enchantment ensures that all Elements are empowered continually."
SCENARIO_RELIC_StaffOfElements_Start_2,This is madness! The Demons will use these Elements to their advantage.
SCENARIO_RELIC_StaffOfElements_Start_3,"My advice, move early and use whichever Elements the Demons will consume where you can."
SCENARIO_RELIC_StaffOfElements_Success_1,"With all the Demons defeated, you look at the Staff in your hands."
SCENARIO_RELIC_StaffOfElements_Success_2,"The carving is impressive enough, but you wonder if the effort you went through has been properly rewarded with this prize."
SCENARIO_RELIC_StaffOfSummoning_SM1_DESC,All Summons get <nobr>+2 Attack <sprite name=Attack></nobr>
SCENARIO_RELIC_StaffOfSummoning_SM2_DESC,All Summons get <nobr>+2 Move <sprite name=Move></nobr>
SCENARIO_RELIC_StaffOfSummoning_SM3_DESC,All Heroes get <nobr>-1 Attack <sprite name=Attack></nobr>
SCENARIO_RELIC_StaffOfSummoning_Start_1,There is a strange magical aura in the place which creates lethargy and weakness in all but summoned creatures.
SCENARIO_RELIC_StaffOfSummoning_Start_2,You must use your summons wisely and protect them as they will surely bring you victory!
SCENARIO_RELIC_StaffOfSummoning_Success_1,The crypt is quiet once again and the Staff is now yours!
SCENARIO_RELIC_StaffOfXorn_Room_2_1,"This looks like the main part of the shrine, and if I’m not mistaken, there is a spare Staff in that chest over there!"
SCENARIO_RELIC_StaffOfXorn_SM1_DESC,Inox Shaman have Muddle & Poison on all Attacks
SCENARIO_RELIC_StaffOfXorn_Start_1,"Try to take down the Shamans as quickly as possible: as expected, they have Muddle and Poison on all attacks!"
SCENARIO_RELIC_StaffOfXorn_Start_2,"You’ll need to wipe out the Inox out here, and then head inside."
SCENARIO_RELIC_StaffOfXorn_Success_1,"Great work, this tribe is now a lesson to others that try to become too powerful."
SCENARIO_RELIC_SteamArmor_Room_3_1,Stone Golems as well? He really wanted to test the limits of his armor!
SCENARIO_RELIC_SteamArmor_Room_3_2,Looks like it’ll be in that chest though.
SCENARIO_RELIC_SteamArmor_SM1_DESC,All Enemies get <nobr>+2 Move <sprite name=Move></nobr>
SCENARIO_RELIC_SteamArmor_Start_1,"As you enter the tower, you see the problem immediately, Frost coats the room."
SCENARIO_RELIC_SteamArmor_Start_2,It seems someone was testing out his armor by summoning demons.
SCENARIO_RELIC_SteamArmor_Start_3,"I’m also detecting an aura on these enemies, they are able to move faster than normal"
SCENARIO_RELIC_SteamArmor_Success_1,You leave the tower with the Armor slung over your back.
SCENARIO_RELIC_SteelRing_SM1_DESC,Heroes and Summons take 1 Damage at the end of every turn
SCENARIO_RELIC_SteelRing_Start_1,"The curse on this tomb will drain your health at the end of your turn, so keep your health up. Remember to Loot the treasure!"
SCENARIO_RELIC_SteelRing_Success_1,"You kill the last enemy, grab the loot and immediately turn to the exit, dragging your wounded allies with you."
SCENARIO_STORY_BANDITCOMMANDER_Room_2_1,A rock man and his rat friend? You must be the two who have been hampering my operations.
SCENARIO_STORY_BANDITCOMMANDER_Room_2_2,"Well, you are just in time to witness my successful research of necromancy, raised from the ashes of your own temple!"
SCENARIO_STORY_BANDITCOMMANDER_Room_2_3,"My advice, take him down as quickly as possible. He’ll be able to summon a lot of enemies otherwise!"
SCENARIO_STORY_BANDITCOMMANDER_Room_2_4,I also sense that the temple itself heals the undead. Be careful!
SCENARIO_STORY_BANDITCOMMANDER_SM1_DESC,All Undead heal 1 Health at the end of each turn
SCENARIO_STORY_BANDITCOMMANDER_START_1,"Lug crates here, lug crates there... I thought Bandit life might be a bit more exciting."
SCENARIO_STORY_BANDITCOMMANDER_START_2,You mean you’d rather be in the cave with those things?
SCENARIO_STORY_BANDITCOMMANDER_START_3,"You have a point….Wait a minute, who’s there?"
SCENARIO_STORY_BANDITCOMMANDER_START_4,"You’ve been spotted, time to attack!"
SCENARIO_STORY_BANDITCOMMANDER_SUCCESS_1,"The Temple of the Ashes is silent again. You decide that it should stay that way, and seal the entrance as you leave."
SCENARIO_STORY_BEASTTYRANT_1_Room_2_1,"The cave leads into a sewer system, this whole network is corrupted."
SCENARIO_STORY_BEASTTYRANT_1_START_1,"Well, this is a new one to me, allied snakes?"
SCENARIO_STORY_BEASTTYRANT_1_START_2,Normally I’d be relieved but not with those horrid things in the room over there!
SCENARIO_STORY_BEASTTYRANT_1_SUCCESS_1,"As the last of the Rot is destroyed you make a sigh of relief, this cave network has been cleansed."
SCENARIO_STORY_BEASTTYRANT_2_Room_2_1,"Here are the sewers where the Rot has spread from, it needs clearing."
SCENARIO_STORY_BEASTTYRANT_2_SM1_DESC,All Enemies start Disarmed
SCENARIO_STORY_BEASTTYRANT_2_START_1,"We’ve surprised them this time, quick, attack while they are disarmed!"
SCENARIO_STORY_BEASTTYRANT_2_SUCCESS_1,"Another part of the world is free from Rot, but where else will it have spread?"
SCENARIO_STORY_BEASTTYRANT_3_START_1,"These Deep Terrors are going to keep coming, we need to get the Bears here as quickly as possible!"
SCENARIO_STORY_BEASTTYRANT_3_START_2,Yet bears are notoriously slow moving!
SCENARIO_STORY_BEASTTYRANT_3_START_3,In that case we should really try and give them a push!
SCENARIO_STORY_BEASTTYRANT_3_SUCCESS_1,"With a majority of the Terrors dead, they stop spawning and you are free to explore the cave system."
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_1_Room_2_1,I don’t ever recall City Guard having service hounds.
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_1_Room_2_2,"We’re, uh, City Guard! And we says stop in the name of the City!"
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_1_Room_2_3,I have an odd feeling that these may be bandits playing dress-up.
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_1_Room_2_4,So the Berserker didn’t just go berserk and make us murder a whole bunch of guards? I hope you’re right…
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_1_START_1,"I get she’s called the Berserker, but isn’t killing Guards a little, er, berserk?"
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_1_START_2,"We’ll talk about this later. First, we need to get out of here alive."
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_1_SUCCESS_1,"With the camp empty, you are free to explore."
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_1_SUCCESS_2,"Inside one tent, you find a number of naked bodies next to a pile of dirty, torn clothes. The kind of clothes bandits would wear."
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_1_SUCCESS_3,Looks like you were right — they were just bandits after some better clothes.
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_1_SUCCESS_4,It is good to know that we didn’t break any laws today.
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_2_Room_2_1,I didn’t think that the Overseer is a Harrower…
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_2_Room_2_2,The Overseer sends his regards!
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_2_Room_2_3,"It looks like we’ve missed him again. Kill these Harrowers, and we can find out where he’s heading!"
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_2_START_1,I don’t think these Vermlings are common in this part of the realm.
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_2_START_2,I think the Harrowers behind them hissing orders and cracking whips might have something to do with that...
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_2_START_3,"Point taken. Push on through these Harrowers, and we should find the Overseer at the puppet strings."
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_2_START_4,And be merciful to the Vermlings. They’re being forced to fight.
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_2_SUCCESS_1,"Near the centre of Ironwood Camp, you find the Vermlings have amassed large piles of metal in wagons, surrounded by ledgers and documents. There is definitely a larger plan at work."
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_2_SUCCESS_2,"How did the Overseer make friends with Harrowers? Actually, how does anyone do it?"
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_2_SUCCESS_3,"I don’t know, but it seems like he’s involved with the goings on at Keyport. We have to be careful."
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_3_Room_2_1,See! Speak of the devil…
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_3_Room_2_2,"Keep fighting, you can’t be far from the Overseer!"
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_3_Room_3_1,They just keep coming! How are you going to fight them all?
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_3_Room_3_2,"This is getting too dangerous. You see those doors? Those lead into the quarters of one of the bandit leaders. Get in there, grab anything useful, then get out!"
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_3_Room_4_1,"Okay, grab those papers!"
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_3_Room_4_2,"Then get out of here! I can’t lose idiots to sell junk— I mean, valued customers!"
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_3_START_1,I’ve never seen so many Vermlings in one place. And with bandits? The smell is worse than the manure stand I used to run.<br>
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_3_START_2,There’s enough Vermlings here to start an army… where do the Harrowers fit in this?
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_3_START_3,"… Wait, a manure stand?"
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_3_START_4,"Shh, don’t mention Harrowers! You’ve jinxed it now."
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_3_SUCCESS_1,"The cold air steams your breath as you escape the cave, but you don’t stop with Vermlings hot on your heels. By the time you stop running, you can see Millpond in the distance."
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_3_SUCCESS_2,I wouldn’t go anywhere near that cave again if I were you.
SCENARIO_STORY_BERSERKER_3_SUCCESS_3,"Get back here, and we’ll see if what you grabbed can give us any advantage when you go back in."
SCENARIO_STORY_BRUTE_1_ROOM_3,You push through to a clearing in the forest and are surprised to see Inox in charge of the hounds. They wear the markings of a traitor from your tribe. This is no random attack!
SCENARIO_STORY_BRUTE_1_START_1,"Hounds come crashing out of the woods and you step forwards to protect Scabwit, but he is having none of it: ‘I can defend myself just fine, you know!’<br>You aren’t sure of that, you’d better keep him alive if you want to get paid!"
SCENARIO_STORY_BRUTE_1_SUCCESS_1,"With the hounds and Inox dead, you walk over to a body. You were right: the markings are similar to those of the old chief’s bodyguard, who killed the chief in his sleep and took his axe."
SCENARIO_STORY_BRUTE_2_START_1,"My scouts are reporting Inox Warriors with humans flooding through the forest. They are heading right towards us, so expect heavy resistance."
SCENARIO_STORY_BRUTE_2_START_2,"We’ll make a stand here. If we take down enough of them, they should rout. My tribemates will help."
SCENARIO_STORY_BRUTE_2_SUCCESS_1,"Faced with the solid resolve, the attackers turn tail and flee back into the forest. It looks like you have won!"
SCENARIO_STORY_BRUTE_3_Room_2,In this room Inox Shaman are summoning the Demons. They must be stopped!
SCENARIO_STORY_BRUTE_3_SM1_DESC,Brute is permanently Strengthened
SCENARIO_STORY_BRUTE_3_START_1,"The thought of Inox and Demons working together fills you with rage, and you charge forwards to destroy them all!"
SCENARIO_STORY_BRUTE_3_SUCCESS_1,"You don’t know how many of these Demons have already been summoned, but this should put a stop to any more adding to his army."
SCENARIO_STORY_BRUTE_3_SUCCESS_2,"In a book in the corner, you find instructions on how to enter the inner lair of the Traitor – as long as his troops are out of the way first!"
SCENARIO_STORY_BeastTyrant_1_SM1_DESC,Giant Vipers get +2 Move
SCENARIO_STORY_CRAGHEART_1_START_1,"That’s it, crowbar the head off that statue. It’ll fetch a pretty penny in some Lord’s estate."
SCENARIO_STORY_CRAGHEART_1_START_2,"Some of these look almost lifelike. Look at that one by the door, he– wait, was it there a minute ago…? Oh damn, he’s got friends!"
SCENARIO_STORY_CRAGHEART_1_SUCCESS_1,These guys are obviously an organized band dealing in looting and robbery: the entrance of the shrine is filled with stolen goods.
SCENARIO_STORY_CRAGHEART_1_SUCCESS_2,"The good news is that we should be able to make a bit of money selling this. But, if I were you, I’d check out that any other shrines in the area are safe!"
SCENARIO_STORY_CRAGHEART_2_START_1,"The place is crowded with hostiles, far too many for you to handle. If you are smart about it, you may be able to take them all down."
SCENARIO_STORY_CRAGHEART_2_START_2,"Earth is strong here, use it to your advantage!"
SCENARIO_STORY_CRAGHEART_2_SUCCESS_1,Silence holds dominion in the now bloody halls of the Shrine of the Roots. You can feel a gentle breeze singing in the stony cracks of your skin.
SCENARIO_STORY_CRAGHEART_3_START_1,"As you head into the central chamber, surrounded by stone monoliths, you realise your sixth sense was correct, bandits leap out to attack you and it seems they have managed to access this shrine’s ancient defences."
SCENARIO_STORY_CRAGHEART_3_START_2,"Dammit, they have elite Stone Golems. Stay out of their way and take them down at range!"
SCENARIO_STORY_CRAGHEART_3_START_3,"Ice is powerful here. Use that to slow them down, if you can."
SCENARIO_STORY_CRAGHEART_3_SUCCESS_1,"You stare at the crumbling remains of the once-glorious golem, for a moment, before the cold brings you back to your senses."
SCENARIO_STORY_CaptainOfTheGuard_IMMUNITYSM1_DESC,Party are immune to the poison condition
SCENARIO_STORY_CaptainOfTheGuard_ROOM_3_1,"How dare you resist! I will rid humanity of the restraints of the other races, and you won’t stop me!"
SCENARIO_STORY_CaptainOfTheGuard_ROOM_3_2,"You know, he sounds like a real cliché villain. I don’t know how we didn’t guess beforehand."
SCENARIO_STORY_CaptainOfTheGuard_ROOM_3_3,I wonder if he’d be more mad if he knew a Harrower’s magic was protecting us from his poisonous pets? 
SCENARIO_STORY_CaptainOfTheGuard_Room_2_1,"Well, if you wanted more evidence that those mercenaries from the Harrower Hives were working with the City Guard, I guess these pet snakes are it. The drakes are new, though."
SCENARIO_STORY_CaptainOfTheGuard_Room_2_2,Something smells... different about the snake and drake venom. What have you done?
SCENARIO_STORY_CaptainOfTheGuard_Room_2_3,It seems to be a magical neutralisation. I’m almost inclined to say that the Plagueherald’s cure-all is… working? Extraordinary — I must speak to it when you return. 
SCENARIO_STORY_CaptainOfTheGuard_START_1,"Reclaim Demonsgate for humanity? Whatever he means, it sounds bad. Fight your way to him, and end this. "
SCENARIO_STORY_CaptainOfTheGuard_START_2,You shall threaten Demonsgate with your dirty selves no longer!
SCENARIO_STORY_CaptainOfTheGuard_START_3,"I’m sorry, but how exactly are we a threat to Demonsgate? All we seem to do is get paid for saving the darn place."
SCENARIO_STORY_CaptainOfTheGuard_SUCCESS_1,"The Captain of The Guard falls to the ground, and the crooked City Guard defending him begin to flee."
SCENARIO_STORY_CaptainOfTheGuard_SUCCESS_2,"With the last of his strength, the captain stares at the Doomstalker and the Plagueherald. “You two are the worst filth of them all,” he growls, before succumbing to his wounds.  "
SCENARIO_STORY_CaptainOfTheGuard_SUCCESS_3,"I’ll pass this location and everything else we know to one of my old friends in the City Guard, and make sure to stamp this out for good."
SCENARIO_STORY_Cragheart_1_SM1_DESC,At the start of each round the Air Element is set to Strong
SCENARIO_STORY_Cragheart_2_SM1_DESC,At the start of each round the Earth Element is set to Strong
SCENARIO_STORY_Cragheart_3_SM1_DESC,At the start of each round the Ice Element is set to Strong
SCENARIO_STORY_DarkRider_SCENARIO_MODIFIER_1,The Dark Rider will teleport in before its turn and teleport away after melee attacking
SCENARIO_STORY_DarkRider_START_1,"You step out into the main hall. Somehow, a forest has grown inside it. You hear the heavy hoofbeats come toward you, and turn to face your attacker."
SCENARIO_STORY_DarkRider_START_2,"A heavily armoured, headless spirit has its body turned down toward you from atop an oversized warhorse. The earlier voice booms again, but this time from the spirit. "
SCENARIO_STORY_DarkRider_START_3,"“You have fought valiantly in the protection of your realm. I am the Dark Rider, and while this realm is mine to destroy, I shall offer you a deal.”"
SCENARIO_STORY_DarkRider_START_4,"“Given your prowess, you may battle me for ownership of your realm. Win, and I will not involve myself or my realms with yours any longer. But lose, and I shall turn your Guild to dust so that I may once again spread my creatures through these lands unimpeded.” "
SCENARIO_STORY_DarkRider_START_5,"You nod, and the Dark Rider disappears into the forest. “Good luck,” booms the voice. “You’ll need it.”"
SCENARIO_STORY_DarkRider_START_6,"Well, it would seem we have a far bigger interplanar reputation than we thought…"
SCENARIO_STORY_DarkRider_START_7,"Try not to lose this one, okay? All of my best stock is in this realm. "
SCENARIO_STORY_DarkRider_SUCCESS_1,"The forest erupts in an ear-piercing shriek as you land another blow on the headless spectre. Black smoke hisses from the newly-forming cracks in its armour, spurting out until the dark, heavy suit rolls empty off of the horse. "
SCENARIO_STORY_DarkRider_SUCCESS_2,"At this, the warhorse simply topples over, dead."
SCENARIO_STORY_DarkRider_SUCCESS_3,"Finally, the forest recedes from the floor of the main hall. The oil lamps begin to burn again, and warmth returns to the Guild. The air feels lighter."
SCENARIO_STORY_Doomstalker_1_Room_3_1,They brought wild Vermlings with them? Who takes wild Vermlings anywhere?
SCENARIO_STORY_Doomstalker_1_Room_3_2,"Someone wanting to destroy a farm… Kill them quickly, they’ll make short work of the Orchids’ crops and livestock otherwise!"
SCENARIO_STORY_Doomstalker_1_START_1,They really came back again? So soon? Someone must be paying them well.
SCENARIO_STORY_Doomstalker_1_START_2,I recognise their sigil; they’re mercenaries. Take them out! One of them must have something on them that points to their employer.
SCENARIO_STORY_Doomstalker_1_SUCCESS_1,"As the last attacker falls, you’re able to fully take in the destruction before you. It seems some of the raiders slipped through the fight: crops and livestock alike lay dismembered."
SCENARIO_STORY_Doomstalker_1_SUCCESS_2,"The Doomstalker walks into the carnage, and pauses. He continues on, as though on a path only he can see. When you catch up to him, he gestures to a faint trail of blood leading away from the camp."
SCENARIO_STORY_Doomstalker_2_Room_2_1,"Okay, why would a fake butcher’s shop have a room full of undead?"
SCENARIO_STORY_Doomstalker_2_Room_2_2,"I suppose rotten meat is probably much cheaper to stock a fake store with, so–"
SCENARIO_STORY_Doomstalker_2_Room_2_3,Don't finish what you’re saying. This store looks a lot like where I used to do my weekly meat shop.
SCENARIO_STORY_Doomstalker_2_Room_2_4,"...Just don’t pass out on me again, alright? I couldn’t catch you last time."
SCENARIO_STORY_Doomstalker_2_START_1,I don’t think I’ve ever seen the City Guard on duty in the Crooked Bazaar before…<br>
SCENARIO_STORY_Doomstalker_2_START_2,And I don’t think I’ve ever seen the City Guard on time for anything. Do you think needing to stop this smell forced them to do their jobs?
SCENARIO_STORY_Doomstalker_2_START_3,"There’s no time to explain things to the City Guard, and you can’t fight all of them. Get through to that ledger, and get out before they can catch you."
SCENARIO_STORY_Doomstalker_2_SUCCESS_1,"Fighting through, you snatch the ledger from the greasy floor and burst out of the store’s back door. You never thought the Crooked Bazaar’s air would smell fresh, but it does now."
SCENARIO_STORY_Doomstalker_2_SUCCESS_2,You promise yourself that you’ll stay away from meat for a while.
SCENARIO_STORY_Doomstalker_3_Room_3_1,"Good, you made it inside. Dispatch these mercenaries so we can search their records for their employer. "
SCENARIO_STORY_Doomstalker_3_Room_3_2,"And loot what you can! You’ve made me want to, um, take in extra stock."
SCENARIO_STORY_Doomstalker_3_START_1,You’re not dead are you? You’re carrying my best stock!
SCENARIO_STORY_Doomstalker_3_START_2,"The remaining Savvas seem to think you dead. Take them by surprise, regroup, and get inside that dungeon."
SCENARIO_STORY_Doomstalker_3_SUCCESS_1,"With the blood of the last mercenary dripping off of your weapons, you are free to search their headquarters."
SCENARIO_STORY_Doomstalker_3_SUCCESS_2,"By the time you’re done, you’ve amassed several large logbooks and piles of letters. This is clearly a big operation, and they are not the only part of it. "
SCENARIO_STORY_Doomstalker_3_SUCCESS_3,"You also find a stack of considerably large crates, stuffed with City Guard issue equipment and bearing a strange sigil. They look like past payments.  "
SCENARIO_STORY_ELEMENTALIST_1_START_1,The village is overgrown and many of the buildings have collapsed: all the villagers left generations ago.
SCENARIO_STORY_ELEMENTALIST_1_START_2,"As you start to explore, long-undisturbed bones rise from the undergrowth. Apparently all the villagers didn’t leave after all."
SCENARIO_STORY_ELEMENTALIST_1_SUCCESS_1,It seems as if the village is silent once more.
SCENARIO_STORY_ELEMENTALIST_2_ROOM_3_1,"The door opens into a library, which is still in reasonably good condition. This may hold the answers you seek."
SCENARIO_STORY_ELEMENTALIST_2_ROOM_3_2,I think we may need to deal with those Golems first!
SCENARIO_STORY_ELEMENTALIST_2_Room_2_1,I can see some Pressure Plates on the floor there. Apparently someone didn’t want just anyone getting into the room in the back.
SCENARIO_STORY_ELEMENTALIST_2_START_1,"As you enter the tower, a smell of sulphur hits your nostrils. Drake droppings..."
SCENARIO_STORY_ELEMENTALIST_2_SUCCESS_1,"The Tower is now free from things trying to kill us, so let’s have a root around."
SCENARIO_STORY_ELEMENTALIST_3_Room_2_1,At the back of this room you notice a number of strange altars of bones.
SCENARIO_STORY_ELEMENTALIST_3_Room_2_2,"That is a summoning altar. You must destroy it, or more Demons will spawn!"
SCENARIO_STORY_ELEMENTALIST_3_SM2_DESC,All Heroes start with 2 Curses in their deck.
SCENARIO_STORY_ELEMENTALIST_3_START_1,"The passageway leads downwards for a few minutes, as if you are heading into the centre of the earth itself. The temperature starts to rise, and you feel more and more apprehensive."
SCENARIO_STORY_ELEMENTALIST_3_START_2,"There is magic at work here, I can feel dark forces. A strong curse covers this place"
SCENARIO_STORY_ELEMENTALIST_3_START_3,"The passage levels out, and you enter into more of a necropolis than a temple."
SCENARIO_STORY_ELEMENTALIST_3_START_4,Demons? Why would Swagger visit this place? We must investigate!
SCENARIO_STORY_ELEMENTALIST_3_SUCCESS_1,"With the Demons dead, and the altars destroyed, the curse is lifted on this place."
SCENARIO_STORY_HIGHCULTIST_Room_2_1,"Passing through the doorway, you are met by unwelcome sight: a Cultist is bathed in demonic power. He turns, and laughs…"
SCENARIO_STORY_HIGHCULTIST_Room_2_2,"What do we have here, more foolish adventurers? I have met your kind before: they are dead, and I remain."
SCENARIO_STORY_HIGHCULTIST_Room_2_3,"You look around the room. You are outnumbered. This is going to end badly… Just then, a familiar voice calls out…"
SCENARIO_STORY_HIGHCULTIST_Room_2_4,‘Your Boon has been granted!’ A number of Spitting Drakes and a Golem phase in beside you. It seems the odds aren’t so heavily stacked against you after all...
SCENARIO_STORY_HIGHCULTIST_START_1,"As you walk down stone steps carved from the same black material, you struggle to remember the name... obsidian?"
SCENARIO_STORY_HIGHCULTIST_START_2,"When you enter the first chamber, you realise this is not going to be an easy battle. Cultists and Demons bar your way forwards."
SCENARIO_STORY_HIGHCULTIST_SUCCESS_1,"After an intense battle, the High Cultist and his followers are dead."
SCENARIO_STORY_INOXBODYGUARD_ROOM_3_1,"The door swings open, and he stands in the room holding a giant axe."
SCENARIO_STORY_INOXBODYGUARD_ROOM_3_2,I used your chieftain’s own axe to kill him you know. He died in one swing. I expect you to do the same.
SCENARIO_STORY_INOXBODYGUARD_SM1_DESC,At the start of each round the Dark Element is set to Strong
SCENARIO_STORY_INOXBODYGUARD_START_1,"You see a door at the back leading to his private chambers, but first you must fight your way through his personal guard."
SCENARIO_STORY_INOXBODYGUARD_SUCCESS_1,"With the Inox Traitor dead, you feel a weight lift off of your mind. You pick up his axe and head to the exit."
SCENARIO_STORY_JEKSERAH_ROOM_3_1,That’s… Jekserah. It seems she’s worked out how to control Demons too...
SCENARIO_STORY_JEKSERAH_ROOM_3_2,"With both, I can rule Gloomhaven with a fist of rot!"
SCENARIO_STORY_JEKSERAH_ROOM_3_3,This smell is UNBEARABLE! Please kill her before she summons more Undead.<br>
SCENARIO_STORY_JEKSERAH_Room_2_1,Why do we have to keep finding dungeons full of things that want us dead?
SCENARIO_STORY_JEKSERAH_Room_2_2,You bring the book that time forgot…
SCENARIO_STORY_JEKSERAH_Room_2_3,Keep going. That voice is getting closer.
SCENARIO_STORY_JEKSERAH_START_1,"Whatever these Living Bones are doing here, they’re likely courtesy of our thief. Press through."
SCENARIO_STORY_JEKSERAH_START_2,You cleared the Sanctuary I could not…
SCENARIO_STORY_JEKSERAH_START_3,"I vote we don’t follow the creepy voice, and turn around now please!"
SCENARIO_STORY_JEKSERAH_SUCCESS_1,"Jekserah screams her defeat, and as she falls her Demon and Undead minions fall with her. Her plans have been foiled, for now."
SCENARIO_STORY_JEKSERAH_SUCCESS_2,"The Quartermaster begins collecting the stolen weapons from bone piles and flesh puddles, while the Summoner delves into the journals in Jekserah’s pockets."
SCENARIO_STORY_JEKSERAH_SUCCESS_3,"You, uh, see Jekserah’s ring? Do you think you could bring it back for me?"
SCENARIO_STORY_MERCILESSOVERSEER_Room_2_1,"Oh, here you are! I can’t wait to kill that pitiful Inox and her friends like I slaughtered the rest of her tribe!"
SCENARIO_STORY_MERCILESSOVERSEER_Room_2_2,I'd be able to understand him better if he didn't wear that ridiculous mask
SCENARIO_STORY_MERCILESSOVERSEER_Room_2_3,"Watch out for the Vermlings — the Overseer can use his whip to make them fight even harder, the poor creatures..."
SCENARIO_STORY_MERCILESSOVERSEER_SM1_DESC,All Vermlings have +1 Shield
SCENARIO_STORY_MERCILESSOVERSEER_START_1,"So, that explains the metal at Ironwood…"
SCENARIO_STORY_MERCILESSOVERSEER_START_2,The Vermlings look like adorable little knights. Shame you have to fight them.
SCENARIO_STORY_MERCILESSOVERSEER_START_3,"‘Now you’ve returned, this cave will become your tomb!’"
SCENARIO_STORY_MERCILESSOVERSEER_START_4,I think that voice is the Overseer.
SCENARIO_STORY_MERCILESSOVERSEER_START_5,Would you mind shutting him up? The main chamber is straight ahead.
SCENARIO_STORY_MERCILESSOVERSEER_SUCCESS_1,"Even before the Overseer falls dead to the ground, the Berserker is on him with her blades."
SCENARIO_STORY_MERCILESSOVERSEER_SUCCESS_2,"You decide it is best to leave her to... make her peace, and help the newly-freed Vermlings release their caged kin."
SCENARIO_STORY_MERCILESSOVERSEER_SUCCESS_3,"Well done, you’ve stopped a Vermling army ravaging the land."
SCENARIO_STORY_MERCILESSOVERSEER_SUCCESS_4,"Well, it would have been a particularly warm and furry way to die…but yes, congratulations are in order."
SCENARIO_STORY_MINDTHIEF_1_START_1,"Your fellow Vermlings have fled through the way you entered, leaving you and the pack’s rat swarm to guard their backs."
SCENARIO_STORY_MINDTHIEF_1_START_2,"To give them time, you must defeat the Bandit leaders, whilst ensuring your swarm isn’t entirely defeated."
SCENARIO_STORY_MINDTHIEF_1_SUCCESS_1,"You hear the signal that everyone is safe, and so leave your home and head for the surface."
SCENARIO_STORY_MINDTHIEF_1_SUCCESS_2,"The remaining Bandits don’t give chase, but you catch the scent of smoke down the tunnels. Your home is no more."
SCENARIO_STORY_MINDTHIEF_2_ROOM_3,Bandits have learned how to train Bears now. Will wonders never cease?
SCENARIO_STORY_MINDTHIEF_2_START_1,The bandit encampment appears to be light on manpower as you attack... but Hounds? They have a lot of Hounds!
SCENARIO_STORY_MINDTHIEF_2_START_2,You’ll need to loot 3 chests of supplies to succeed. They’ll likely have a bit of gold in too!
SCENARIO_STORY_MINDTHIEF_2_SUCCESS_1,"You secured a feast, and the pack will live to fight another day. Time to regroup and take back what is yours."
SCENARIO_STORY_MINDTHIEF_3_START_1,"You sneak past the incapacitated guards outside, and witness the results of your strategy with satisfaction. The opposition is numerous, but not as fierce at it used to be. Now you have a fighting chance!"
SCENARIO_STORY_MINDTHIEF_3_START_2,"Your herbs have sent the animals into a wild frenzy, they are attacking anyone in range. I’d stay back if you can."
SCENARIO_STORY_MINDTHIEF_3_SUCCESS_1,"You have claimed back your territory, and a great feast is in order! It is clear, however, that none of these goons were in command, which means more will return. You need to put an end to this invasion yourself."
SCENARIO_STORY_Mindthief_3_SM1_DESC,All Bandit Guards and Archers start Poisoned
SCENARIO_STORY_NIGHTSHROUD_1_Room_4_1,"That looks like the exit, don’t leave anyone behind!"
SCENARIO_STORY_NIGHTSHROUD_1_START_1,"This is unfortunate, we are a LONG way underground."
SCENARIO_STORY_NIGHTSHROUD_1_START_2,"Yes, there are a lot of corridors to pass through until we see daylight again."
SCENARIO_STORY_NIGHTSHROUD_1_START_3,But we also must kill enough Living Spirits on the way to ensure the Nightshroud recovers enough research!
SCENARIO_STORY_NIGHTSHROUD_1_SUCCESS_1,You escape out of the crypt with the samples.
SCENARIO_STORY_NIGHTSHROUD_2_Room_2_1,"They’ve managed to activate some Stone Golems in defence, avoid them if you can.<br>"
SCENARIO_STORY_NIGHTSHROUD_2_Room_4_1,"Hounds this way, they are too fast to outrun!"
SCENARIO_STORY_NIGHTSHROUD_2_SM1_DESC,Enemies start muddled
SCENARIO_STORY_NIGHTSHROUD_2_START_1,"We’ve certainly got the drop on them, but I can’t see any Harrowers in here."
SCENARIO_STORY_NIGHTSHROUD_2_START_2,"We’ll need to spread out as I expect the Harrowers will be in different parts of the sewer, and it is a pretty big network."
SCENARIO_STORY_NIGHTSHROUD_2_START_3,"Don’t take too long though, or they’ll be able to escape!"
SCENARIO_STORY_NIGHTSHROUD_2_SUCCESS_1,"With all the Harrowers dead, the other enemies flee into side passages."
SCENARIO_STORY_NIGHTSHROUD_3_START_1,"The Lurkers must be further in the cave system, but these are also home to some very unpleasant Savvas."
SCENARIO_STORY_NIGHTSHROUD_3_START_2,We’ll have to kill everything to have access to the Lurker’s remains I think.
SCENARIO_STORY_NIGHTSHROUD_3_SUCCESS_1,"With all the enemies dead, you can actually take a moment to enjoy the beauty of these caves."
SCENARIO_STORY_NIGHTSHROUD_3_SUCCESS_2,The ambience is kind of ruined by the Nightshroud hacking at that Lurker corpse over there though...
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_1_Room_2_1,Where do you even find this many people willing to enter a Harrower hive?
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_1_Room_2_2,Wouldn’t you enter one if you could get your pet snake to eat all the Harrowers?
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_1_Room_2_3, I’m not going to answer that because I don’t want our friend here to give me some magical bug-fever.
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_1_START_1,Who else in their right mind would trudge through the desert and stop at a Harrower hive?
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_1_START_2,"An archer stamps into the hive, flanked by more bandits and what appear to be domesticated vipers. “Death to the Harrower filth!” the archer screams."
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_1_START_3,"You really need to stop asking questions you don’t want answered, you know. "
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_1_START_4,"Take out these invaders, and then we can work out why they would come here. "
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_1_SUCCESS_1,"The last mercenary falls, her body slowly sinking into the foul-smelling muck coating the floor. "
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_1_SUCCESS_2,"You reluctantly tear into the mulch to search her, as you searched all her comrades, but none of them were carrying anything of use. You don’t recognise their sigil. "
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_1_SUCCESS_3,"A stream of bugs comes up from the hive and joins the Plagueherald, and another stream quickly returns. “The hive thanks you,” it drones.    "
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_2_Room_2_1,"In the temple’s main chamber, you come across a group of Savvas and human mercenaries fighting among trap-laying paraphernalia. The Savvas are losing."
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_2_Room_2_2,I wonder what would draw so many Savvas into the same place as humans?
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_2_Room_2_3,"Upon noticing you, both groups charge, as if united by a single cause."
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_2_Room_2_4,"Whatever’s making them work together, we should find it. It’s probably extremely valuable. "
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_2_Room_2_5,Deal with any mercenaries you find while you search — one of them is bound to have orders on them.
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_2_Room_3_1,"Those look like ancients texts in that pile, if I ever saw them!"
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_2_Room_3_2,"Grab them, and then clear out the rest of the mercenaries you’ve found – we need to get to the bottom of these attacks. "
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_2_START_1,It seems our invaders got here first. Do you think they’re targeting Harrower hives?
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_2_START_2,"More importantly, do you think all the treasure will be gone already?"
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_2_START_3,"We’d better hope the ancient texts are still here, at least. There should be some storage chambers past this artillery. Look around for them, and kill whatever sees you. "
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_2_SUCCESS_1,"With the texts in hand, and the last mercenary slain, you quickly search through the bodies before reinforcements can turn up."
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_2_SUCCESS_2,"As you search, you see the Plagueherald come to a hover over a cluster of insects twitching on the floor. It scoops them up into itself, and turns to you shortly after."
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_2_SUCCESS_3,"“Stop searching,” it buzzes. “We know what happened.” "
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_3_Room_2_1,"Oh good, the City Guard are here. Hey! Stop them breaking the stools!"
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_3_Room_2_2,You quickly notice the City Guard are standing among the bodies of dead patrons. “Let none escape!” one shouts.
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_3_Room_2_3,"For what it’s worth, you have my apologies. This seems to run deeper than we thought.   "
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_3_START_1,I... can’t believe your plan actually worked. It looks like we crashed some kind of multi-mercenary jolly...
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_3_START_2,"What do you mean the plan worked? I already owe The Sloshed Squirrel a fortune, and now I’m going to have to pay for all the damage we’re about to do!"
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_3_START_3,"I’ll inform the Captain of The Guard that there’s a brawl in The Sloshed Squirrel, with some crooked guards involved. You focus on fighting your way out."
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_3_SUCCESS_1,"Now the last mercenary is dead, you’re able to take in the extent of the decimation before you. "
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_3_SUCCESS_2,"The Sloshed Squirrel is surrounded by the bodies of its patrons, furniture, and the City Guard alike. "
SCENARIO_STORY_Plagueherald_3_SUCCESS_3,"By the time you’ve finished searching the defeated mercenaries, you’ve amassed a decent pile of paperwork to look over. "
SCENARIO_STORY_QUARTERMASTER_1_Room_2_1,Are those Living Corpses… in a Vermling nest?
SCENARIO_STORY_QUARTERMASTER_1_Room_2_2,"I take it that the stinking dead corpse they’re snacking on was the custodian. No glamour in this job, I tell you."
SCENARIO_STORY_QUARTERMASTER_1_Room_2_3,"The quicker you clear out this nest and retrieve the key the better, I think."
SCENARIO_STORY_QUARTERMASTER_1_START_1,Something tells me our custodian and his key are inside…
SCENARIO_STORY_QUARTERMASTER_1_START_2,"Demonsgate should be paying us Guard rates, seeing as we always seem to do their jobs!"
SCENARIO_STORY_QUARTERMASTER_1_SUCCESS_1,"With the last Vermling slain, you’re able to retrieve the Vault key from the half-eaten custodian. You try not to gag as you fish the key out from the corpse."
SCENARIO_STORY_QUARTERMASTER_2_Room_2_1,Living Bones? Great. Now it’s worse than snakes.
SCENARIO_STORY_QUARTERMASTER_2_Room_2_2,Whatever let the animals in likely brought the Living Bones. I’m sure we’ll find our clue in this room.
SCENARIO_STORY_QUARTERMASTER_2_START_1,Isn’t this vault meant to be sealed?
SCENARIO_STORY_QUARTERMASTER_2_START_2,There must be a breach somewhere. We’ll have to find it.
SCENARIO_STORY_QUARTERMASTER_2_START_3,"Well, hurry up and get rid of the snakes at least. This place gives me the creeps."
SCENARIO_STORY_QUARTERMASTER_2_SUCCESS_1,"Now that you’ve driven out snake and skeleton alike, you finally take in your surroundings. Nothing is left in the Vault, save green puddles with a horrific smell."
SCENARIO_STORY_QUARTERMASTER_2_SUCCESS_2,"Following the smell to its source, you find a barely human-sized hole in the room’s corner, soaked in green goo, which leads back up into the streets of Demonsgate."
SCENARIO_STORY_QUARTERMASTER_2_SUCCESS_3,It seems our trail has gone cold. I’ll take some of this… go back to the Enchantress. Maybe she’ll know something about it.
SCENARIO_STORY_QUARTERMASTER_3_Room_2_1,Lurkers and Imps are battling with Living Bones and Corpses as you come through the door into the strange forest. They all turn their attention to you.
SCENARIO_STORY_QUARTERMASTER_3_Room_2_2,A Forest? Inside a cave decorated by Inox? This is getting too much.
SCENARIO_STORY_QUARTERMASTER_3_Room_2_3,"Wherever we are, those Undead have Demonsgate weapons — with any luck, they’re guarding the stockpile."
SCENARIO_STORY_QUARTERMASTER_3_SM1_DESC,All Undead get +1 Attack
SCENARIO_STORY_QUARTERMASTER_3_START_1,Who knew Inox could ever decorate something like this?
SCENARIO_STORY_QUARTERMASTER_3_START_2,"There’s more to Inox than you think. In the meantime, this is exactly the kind of place I would hide stolen weapons..."
SCENARIO_STORY_QUARTERMASTER_3_SUCCESS_1,"The trees rustle in a mysterious breeze as the battle ends. You noticed a strange feeling, a strength, as you entered the undergrowth, and it only feels stronger now."
SCENARIO_STORY_QUARTERMASTER_3_SUCCESS_2,"The Quartermaster has confirmed the Undead’s weapons to be from the stolen stockpile, but their arms account for barely a quarter."
SCENARIO_STORY_QUARTERMASTER_3_SUCCESS_3,"I assume it would have been less than a quarter, but Living Bones do have those extra arms..."
SCENARIO_STORY_QUARTERMASTER_3_SUCCESS_4,"HOWEVER, he did come across a strange artifact. Come back, and we’ll take a look."
SCENARIO_STORY_SCOUNDREL_1_START_1,"The night is foggy and cold, and you have been waiting on that mossy stump for what seems to be hours. Your fingers and toes start to feel numb, but your ears do not: a twig cracks on your left, and out of the gloom come a small group of Bandits. This was...unexpected."
SCENARIO_STORY_SCOUNDREL_1_START_2,"Sorry Luv, the boss has decided you know a bit too much of his grand plan, and well, we’ve been brought in to tie up a few loose ends."
SCENARIO_STORY_SCOUNDREL_1_START_3,"Mind you, he’s paid us your wages, luckily our job is going to be nice and easy..."
SCENARIO_STORY_SCOUNDREL_1_SUCCESS_1,It seems your would-be assassins weren’t lying. They are carrying enough money to cover your original payment.
SCENARIO_STORY_SCOUNDREL_1_SUCCESS_2,"That is kind of irrelevant now: no one double crosses you. Firstly, it’s just plain rude, and secondly, it’s bad for business. And no one messes with your business."
SCENARIO_STORY_SCOUNDREL_2_Room_2,"Stepping into the second clearing, it does not take long to notice that these Vermlings are not led by the Inox you were looking for, but rather by Inox Shaman. One does have markings similar to those you have seen on previous lieutenants, though. Maybe you can get some information out of him after all."
SCENARIO_STORY_SCOUNDREL_2_START_1,"A pack of Vermlings and Hounds are in the forest, but the Inox is nowhere to be seen. You'll have to fight through them to reach the next clearing."
SCENARIO_STORY_SCOUNDREL_2_SUCCESS_1,"As the Shaman falls to the floor, the remaining Vermlings flee out of the clearing. You rush to his side to question him but curse as you realise it is too late: he is already dead. Rummaging through his belongings, you find a simplistic map on a goat skin, with charcoal lines marking the location of a hideout. Your next destination."
SCENARIO_STORY_SCOUNDREL_3_Room_2,"As you open the final door, you expect to see your adversary. But apart from even more Inox, he is nowhere to be found!"
SCENARIO_STORY_SCOUNDREL_3_START_1,"You charge into the campsite. The gathered Inox turn to fight, but they will take a while to react."
SCENARIO_STORY_SCOUNDREL_3_SUCCESS_1,"The Inox army is now all but scattered to the winds. You could easily walk away with their spoils and see justice in that, but you are a woman of principles. The coward has apparently sealed himself in the inner chambers with a supply of food. You’ll have to find another way in, and you’ll need some help!"
SCENARIO_STORY_SIGHTLESSEYE_Room_2_1,"The room opens up and an abomination sits in front of you, a giant stalk with a mouth of razor sharp teeth."
SCENARIO_STORY_SIGHTLESSEYE_Room_2_2,It seems we have finally found the source of the Rot.
SCENARIO_STORY_SIGHTLESSEYE_Room_2_3,Let’s take it out!
SCENARIO_STORY_SIGHTLESSEYE_START_1,"I’ve never smelt anything so unpleasant before, we must be close."
SCENARIO_STORY_SIGHTLESSEYE_START_2,<thud>
SCENARIO_STORY_SIGHTLESSEYE_START_3,Let’s push through these enemies into the room ahead!
SCENARIO_STORY_SIGHTLESSEYE_SUCCESS_1,"As you hit the Sightless Eye for the last time, it shudders and then explodes, showering you all with a foul-smelling goo."
SCENARIO_STORY_SIGHTLESSEYE_SUCCESS_2,That… was unpleasant.
SCENARIO_STORY_SOOTHSINGER_1_START_1,"You all groggily get to your feet, the alcohol dulling your senses."
SCENARIO_STORY_SOOTHSINGER_1_START_2,"Strange silhouettes stumble out of the trees. You initially think they are drunk revellers, but the stench of the Undead comes on the wind."
SCENARIO_STORY_SOOTHSINGER_1_START_3,To arms! Destroy as many Undead as you can!
SCENARIO_STORY_SOOTHSINGER_1_SUCCESS_1,"The Undead hordes stop coming through the trees, and the forest is silent, apart from the heavy breaths taken by the survivors."
SCENARIO_STORY_SOOTHSINGER_2_START_1,Undead again. What are the chances of this happening twice?
SCENARIO_STORY_SOOTHSINGER_2_START_2,"Let’s discuss this later. For now, we have some bones to break."
SCENARIO_STORY_SOOTHSINGER_2_START_3,I’m detecting strong magic nearby. You’ll need to head to the other clearings and shut down whatever is causing the Undead to appear.
SCENARIO_STORY_SOOTHSINGER_2_SUCCESS_1,"As the altars are destroyed, the remaining Undead fall to the ground. The Cultists run off into the undergrowth, defeated."
SCENARIO_STORY_SOOTHSINGER_3_Room_2_1,"Demons & Undead, who are we up against?"
SCENARIO_STORY_SOOTHSINGER_3_START_1,"As you step out into the clearing, a cultist seems surprised to see you."
SCENARIO_STORY_SOOTHSINGER_3_START_2,"You!.... But… He will not be amused! Kill her, now!"
SCENARIO_STORY_SOOTHSINGER_3_START_3,The Cultist points at the Soothsinger as he shouts.
SCENARIO_STORY_SOOTHSINGER_3_START_4,"Kill everything else, but we need that Cultist alive!"
SCENARIO_STORY_SOOTHSINGER_3_SUCCESS_1,"With the Undead & Demons dead, you discover a Cultist hiding under a table, it is time to interrogate him."
SCENARIO_STORY_SPELLWEAVER_1_SM1_DESC,Spellweaver gets <nobr>+1 Attack <sprite name=Attack></nobr> on ranged attacks
SCENARIO_STORY_SPELLWEAVER_1_SM2_DESC,Forest Imps get <nobr>+1 Attack <sprite name=Attack></nobr> on ranged attacks
SCENARIO_STORY_SPELLWEAVER_1_SM3_DESC,At the start of each round the Ice Element is set to Strong
SCENARIO_STORY_SPELLWEAVER_1_START_1,You aren’t going to be able to investigate the area with these Imps around. You’ll have to drive them away.
SCENARIO_STORY_SPELLWEAVER_1_START_2,"Also, it seems as if attacks, both yours and theirs, are more dangerous."
SCENARIO_STORY_SPELLWEAVER_1_SUCCESS_1,"Now the clearing is peaceful, you are able to search around for clues. You find a number of strange scorch marks on the floor, and deduce that powerful demonic summonings have occurred here."
SCENARIO_STORY_SPELLWEAVER_1_SUCCESS_2,"Behind one tree, you find a hastily dug grave. Inside is the body of Bandit, seemingly torn to shreds by talons."
SCENARIO_STORY_SPELLWEAVER_2_ROOM_3_1,And more Demons! Why do people think they can control Demons?
SCENARIO_STORY_SPELLWEAVER_2_SM1_DESC,Characters attacking Cultists gain Disadvantage
SCENARIO_STORY_SPELLWEAVER_2_START_1,"So, these Bandits are working with a Cult. Why am I not surprised?"
SCENARIO_STORY_SPELLWEAVER_2_SUCCESS_1,It seems someone at the top of this Cult has access to some very powerful summoning magic. The only way to restore balance is to take them down.
SCENARIO_STORY_SPELLWEAVER_2_SUCCESS_2,"I feel, however, that currently they may just be too powerful for us to be victorious. We need help..."
SCENARIO_STORY_SPELLWEAVER_3_SM1_DESC,All Elements are set to Inert at the start of every round.
SCENARIO_STORY_SPELLWEAVER_3_START_1,"You awake on the floor of a dusty chamber. Golems, Snakes, and Drakes look on. This is not good."
SCENARIO_STORY_SPELLWEAVER_3_START_2,"The voice speaks again… 'I know why you come, you seek power to defeat the Demon Summoner. This, I can grant you.’"
SCENARIO_STORY_SPELLWEAVER_3_START_3,"‘But first, you must prove you have power within. Defeat the enemies without the Elements to guide you.’"
SCENARIO_STORY_SPELLWEAVER_3_START_4,Something has locked off access to all elements in this tomb. This will be a very dangerous fight!
SCENARIO_STORY_SPELLWEAVER_3_SUCCESS_1,"As the last enemy falls, the voice booms out once more."
SCENARIO_STORY_SPELLWEAVER_3_SUCCESS_2,"‘You have been judged worthy. When you are at your hour of need, I will grant your boon.’"
SCENARIO_STORY_SUMMONER_1_Room_2_1,I suppose Wind Demons explain that odd smell…
SCENARIO_STORY_SUMMONER_1_Room_2_2,"There must be a Demon Altar nearby. Destroy it, and we’ll likely find what the Summoner sensed on our way out."
SCENARIO_STORY_SUMMONER_1_Room_3_1,There’s no altar… Focus on finding an exit. We’ll come back with a plan.
SCENARIO_STORY_SUMMONER_1_Room_3_2,This altar-less rift must be that plane disturbance thingy. Make sure you escape with all my expensive gea— I mean your lives.
SCENARIO_STORY_SUMMONER_1_Room_3_3,Watch your back: the Demons will follow you out.
SCENARIO_STORY_SUMMONER_1_START_1,"You’d think we would have found every creepy Fire Demon-infested dungeon in Gloomhaven by now, right?"
SCENARIO_STORY_SUMMONER_1_START_2,"Especially ones with collapsing entrances. Find a new exit, and watch out for those traps. It looks like they were meant to keep something inside."
SCENARIO_STORY_SUMMONER_1_SUCCESS_1,"Crisp evening air prickles your skin as you stumble out of the trapdoor, panting for your lives."
SCENARIO_STORY_SUMMONER_1_SUCCESS_2,"The Summoner manages to spawn one last bolt of energy down the doorway before she seals it. Though exhausted, her face is full of disgust as she looks at you."
SCENARIO_STORY_SUMMONER_2_Room_3_1,"Our floating... ""friend"" seems to be drawn to this room. This should be the last push."
SCENARIO_STORY_SUMMONER_2_Room_3_2,Hang on. Am I the only one who finds it strange that all of this city fits inside the rotting building we saw outside?
SCENARIO_STORY_SUMMONER_2_Room_3_3,I learned not to ask questions in this profession a long time ago..
SCENARIO_STORY_SUMMONER_2_START_1,There’s no way I’m going near a Harrower. Why are you following one?!
SCENARIO_STORY_SUMMONER_2_START_2,"I think the Summoner, er, summoned it. I’m sure she has a plan."
SCENARIO_STORY_SUMMONER_2_START_3,"If that oversized bug is part of this “plan”, keep it safe. The other things in this library seem to want to kill it as much as they want to kill us."
SCENARIO_STORY_SUMMONER_2_SUCCESS_1,"With the room safe, the Harrower that led you here disintegrates into a cloud of insects. The Summoner gives you a stern look."
SCENARIO_STORY_SUMMONER_2_SUCCESS_2,"After a short while, it reforms holding a battered book. The Summoner takes the book, and engulfs the Harrower in energy from her staff. When the light fades, it’s gone."
SCENARIO_STORY_SUMMONER_3_START_1,It would appear the Summoner has led you straight into the dungeon chamber where the rift resides.
SCENARIO_STORY_SUMMONER_3_START_2,Maybe we were right not to sell that crusty old book...
SCENARIO_STORY_SUMMONER_3_START_3,The Summoner has started a spell of holding to close the rift. You’ll need to stay close by until it finishes — it will take time.
SCENARIO_STORY_SUMMONER_3_START_4,And maybe don’t die? There seem to be more Demons in here than last time!
SCENARIO_STORY_SUMMONER_3_SUCCESS_1,"The Summoner’s body ignites a bright, pale purple and bathes the room. When the glow dims, the Demons and the rift are no more."
SCENARIO_STORY_SUMMONER_3_SUCCESS_2,"However, in the rift’s place sits a steaming, bronze hemisphere. It hisses gently."
SCENARIO_STORY_SUNKEEPER_1_START_1,Everyone still in one piece? Good. Let’s clear this den of animals and get out of here!
SCENARIO_STORY_SUNKEEPER_1_SUCCESS_1,"The last beast falls to the ground and you head straight out, not wanting to get trapped in here if the rocks shift again!"
SCENARIO_STORY_SUNKEEPER_2_Room_3_1,"Here’s the headquarters of the camp, we should find the location of the whole operation if we take these Harrowers out."
SCENARIO_STORY_SUNKEEPER_2_SM1_DESC,All Enemies start Muddled
SCENARIO_STORY_SUNKEEPER_2_START_1,"It seems that little guy has caught them unawares, quick get in while they are confused!"
SCENARIO_STORY_SUNKEEPER_2_SUCCESS_1,"With the enemies dead, you release a small number of Vermlings who inform you that the majority have been taken north."
SCENARIO_STORY_SUNKEEPER_2_SUCCESS_2,Pasted to the wall is a large map of the realm and a big red X is marked on it.
SCENARIO_STORY_SUNKEEPER_3_Room_2_1,"This leads underground, but I can sense a breeze coming through, perhaps a wall has collapsed further in."
SCENARIO_STORY_SUNKEEPER_3_Room_2_2,The Vermlings are getting overrun!
SCENARIO_STORY_SUNKEEPER_3_Room_2_3,"We can’t help them now, we’ll have to regroup and help them later on."
SCENARIO_STORY_SUNKEEPER_3_Room_4_1,"I think I can see sunlight further on, keep going!"
SCENARIO_STORY_SUNKEEPER_3_Room_5_1,"Ah, fresh air, let’s get out of here!"
SCENARIO_STORY_SUNKEEPER_3_START_1,‘You really think I’d be stupid enough to leave an obvious clue like that in one of my secondary camps?’
SCENARIO_STORY_SUNKEEPER_3_START_2,‘Your confidence will be your undoing… Kill them all!’
SCENARIO_STORY_SUNKEEPER_3_START_3,"I don’t know who that was, but the route we came in from is blocked."
SCENARIO_STORY_SUNKEEPER_3_START_4,Our best bet is to kill the Harrowers in charge and get out of here!
SCENARIO_STORY_SUNKEEPER_3_SUCCESS_1,"As you leave this place, the Sunkeeper waves something in her hand, apparently she grabbed something off a Harrower as it died.<br><br>"
SCENARIO_STORY_Sawbones_1_Room_2_1,"Deeper in the forest, you come across a group of Inox and cultists, joined in what appears to be a ritual. Upon seeing you, the cultists get behind the Inox as they form a protective line. <br>"
SCENARIO_STORY_Sawbones_1_Room_2_2,"Well, that was hardly much of a walk into the forest. How did no one else see these idiots from the village?"
SCENARIO_STORY_Sawbones_1_Room_2_3,"I’m more worried about these tribal Inox being in league with humans, especially cultists. Clear them out – I fear we have stumbled onto something important. "
SCENARIO_STORY_Sawbones_1_START_1,How exactly do you get a head-wound lacing a shoe?
SCENARIO_STORY_Sawbones_1_START_2,The same way you break your arm stitching a new sole onto a boot. Imp curses. 
SCENARIO_STORY_Sawbones_1_START_3,"Well, I guess that would explain all these evil imps, now…"
SCENARIO_STORY_Sawbones_1_START_4,"It would, but a village-wide curse isn’t characteristic of imps. Someone or something else is using the imps for their own devices. Be careful."
SCENARIO_STORY_Sawbones_1_SUCCESS_1,"As you cut down the last of the small congregation, you hear a wet cackling from underneath a tree. You turn, and meet the gaze of a heavily-bleeding cultist. "
SCENARIO_STORY_Sawbones_1_SUCCESS_2,"“The imps couldn’t stop you, but no matter,” she splutters. “We Red Talons completed the ritual. Humanity will fall, and you and your healers of the Great Oak will be powerless to stop it!”"
SCENARIO_STORY_Sawbones_1_SUCCESS_3,"The cultist dies laughing. As the life leaves her body, you notice a small, bloody book tumble from her hand."
SCENARIO_STORY_Sawbones_2_START_1,I’m going to get into contact with the convent that runs Blackrock… this is ridiculous. 
SCENARIO_STORY_Sawbones_2_START_2,"You know, I think it’s actually endearing. These lovely old nuns didn’t even notice when I stole all of their silverware."
SCENARIO_STORY_Sawbones_2_START_3,I’m not even going to grace that with a reply. Let’s focus on stopping this ritual. 
SCENARIO_STORY_Sawbones_2_SUCCESS_1,"Your weapon connects with a cultist, knocking him bleeding to the floor. Immediately, all the other inmates stop fighting, and turn their weapons on themselves."
SCENARIO_STORY_Sawbones_2_SUCCESS_2,"“Are you really so easily fooled?” The cultist on the floor is alive, and ecstatic."
SCENARIO_STORY_Sawbones_2_SUCCESS_3,"“After years of planning, our collective deaths completed this ritual. Years of planning, and you finally unleashed the Horror yourselves! It’s glor–”"
SCENARIO_STORY_Sawbones_2_SUCCESS_4,"You finish him off before he can finish his sentence off. Behind you, the Sawbones holds up a letter he has discovered on one of the Inox warriors. "
SCENARIO_STORY_Sawbones_2_SUCCESS_5,"Luckily, the Sawbones also found the keys to the door. You leave before you have to explain yourselves to the nuns."
SCENARIO_STORY_Sawbones_3_Room_2_1,"Harrowers, Inox, Cultists, and demons... all together? Why aren’t they killing each other?<br>"
SCENARIO_STORY_Sawbones_3_Room_2_2,"The Inox roar a battlecry at you as the others laugh. “Without your healers,” one of the Inox shouts, “you cannot stop the Inox from regaining the lands you’ve taken from us!”<br>"
SCENARIO_STORY_Sawbones_3_Room_2_3,"This is truly disturbing, but sadly the village is too far gone. Don’t waste time fighting.   <br>"
SCENARIO_STORY_Sawbones_3_START_1,Demons? Inside the Saltmarsh Flats? Such a large presence of interplanar evil will tear this place apart!
SCENARIO_STORY_Sawbones_3_START_2,"Speaking of a large presence, did anyone else see the giant winged demon claw itself through the void?"
SCENARIO_STORY_Sawbones_3_START_3,"Never mind that! The city is collapsing, and one of you is wearing a pair of boots I really want to sell again. Get out!"
SCENARIO_STORY_Sawbones_3_SUCCESS_1,"You burst out of the burning village into the cool saltmarsh forest, almost slipping off of the narrow path. "
SCENARIO_STORY_Sawbones_3_SUCCESS_2,"Luckily, the village’s blaze has not spread to the surrounding trees. But it is clear that the magical huts of the Saltmarsh Flats, and the wealth of healing knowledge they hold, will not survive the infernal flame. "
SCENARIO_STORY_Sawbones_3_SUCCESS_3,"As you watch the inferno, the northern gate you escaped from collapses, trapping a Night Demon that was trying to reach you. It breaks out in hysterical laughter."
SCENARIO_STORY_Sawbones_3_SUCCESS_4,"“You survived,” it screams, “but it matters not! This village of healers has fallen, and you were kept from stopping the Red Talons. The Horror will burn your Great Oak yet.” The demon dematerializes. "
SCENARIO_STORY_Scoundrel_3_SM1_DESC,All Enemies start Stunned
SCENARIO_STORY_Scoundrel_3_SM2_DESC,All Enemies are permanently Muddled
SCENARIO_STORY_Soothsinger_1_SM1_DESC,All Heroes and Allies start Muddled
SCENARIO_STORY_Soothsinger_2_SM1_DESC,All Heroes and Allies start Strengthened
SCENARIO_STORY_TINKERER_1_ROOM_4_1,"In this room is the remains of what seems to be an old summoning portal, and an old battered chest."
SCENARIO_STORY_TINKERER_1_ROOM_4_2,That chest might hold what you need?
SCENARIO_STORY_TINKERER_1_START_1,"Although this cave is now home to wild animals, you see scorch marks and damage that seems to be of a magical nature. Perhaps this is the right place."
SCENARIO_STORY_TINKERER_1_START_2,"Best to search out the cave, and see if there is anything to find."
SCENARIO_STORY_TINKERER_1_SUCCESS_1,"As well as containing a small pile of ancient coins, the chest has a number of old scrolls. The Tinkerer takes these away for research."
SCENARIO_STORY_TINKERER_2_Room_2_1,"The doorway leads into the ruined temple you expected to find, and here you see more Cultists. They have activated some ancient defence systems!"
SCENARIO_STORY_TINKERER_2_Room_2_2,"Keep going for the Cultists, and then the Golems will deactivate!"
SCENARIO_STORY_TINKERER_2_SM1_DESC,Cultists have permanent <nobr>+2 Shield <sprite name=Shield></nobr>
SCENARIO_STORY_TINKERER_2_SM2_DESC,Cultists heal 1 Health at the end of each Round
SCENARIO_STORY_TINKERER_2_START_1,"Keep your voices down. The High Priest will NOT be amused if anyone finds this location, and you can guarantee I will not take the blame for your mistakes."
SCENARIO_STORY_TINKERER_2_START_2,"Suddenly, he turns to face your location."
SCENARIO_STORY_TINKERER_2_START_3,"Gah, too late. Kill them, quickly!"
SCENARIO_STORY_TINKERER_2_START_4,"Clearly the Cultists are in charge here, I reckon if you kill them, the Bandits will soon disperse!"
SCENARIO_STORY_TINKERER_2_SUCCESS_1,"As the Last Cultist dies, the Golems deactivate immediately and any remaining Bandits head off into the undergrowth. Finally, you are able to look around the temple at your leisure."
SCENARIO_STORY_TINKERER_2_SUCCESS_2,"There is a wealth of information here. These documents describe how to control the elements, and how to open portals to the demonic realms. It is all heresy."
SCENARIO_STORY_TINKERER_2_SUCCESS_3,"It may be heresy, but we should research it! It will help us investigate what the Cultists are planning, and also how to stop them."
SCENARIO_STORY_TINKERER_3_SM1_DESC,Heroes gain <nobr>+1 Attack <sprite name=Attack></nobr>
SCENARIO_STORY_TINKERER_3_SM2_DESC,Heroes have permanent <nobr>+1 Shield <sprite name=Shield></nobr>
SCENARIO_STORY_TINKERER_3_START_1,Something seems different about this Sun Demon: it is aggressive towards the Night Demons. Perhaps we can communicate with it?
SCENARIO_STORY_TINKERER_3_START_2,"It still seems to be aggressive towards us, so try and keep the Night Demons off it. Infusing Light should help it stay alive."
SCENARIO_STORY_TINKERER_3_START_3,"I should be able to close these portals in a short time, keep it alive until then."
SCENARIO_STORY_TINKERER_3_SUCCESS_1,"The dark portals blink out of existence, and the Night Demons disappear along with them. With the threat gone, the Sun Demon becomes more passive."
SCENARIO_STORY_TINKERER_3_SUCCESS_2,"You try to communicate with it, but it gestures its arms and creates a powerful beam of light. You duck for cover but are blinded by the flash."
SCENARIO_STORY_UNDEADCOMMANDER_ROOM_3_1,"Time to kill the last descendant of that meddlesome bard, Melody."
SCENARIO_STORY_UNDEADCOMMANDER_ROOM_3_2,"Here we are, face to face at last..."
SCENARIO_STORY_UNDEADCOMMANDER_Room_2_1,"I have spent generations preparing for this moment, to gain my revenge on the one who trapped me here."
SCENARIO_STORY_UNDEADCOMMANDER_START_1,"The keep is freezing inside, but seemingly silent until a voice booms out…"
SCENARIO_STORY_UNDEADCOMMANDER_START_2,"‘You’ have released the lock? This is better than I had planned, I only wanted you dead, but now, now I will be free!"
SCENARIO_STORY_UNDEADCOMMANDER_START_3,"As the voice goes silent, undead and demons materialise and attack…"
SCENARIO_STORY_UNDEADCOMMANDER_START_4,"We need to push forwards, he must be in a later room!"
SCENARIO_STORY_UNDEADCOMMANDER_SUCCESS_1,"With a scream, the remains of Swagger fall to dust on the ground, it seems the Soothsinger now has nothing to fear."
SCENARIO_STORY_WingedHorror_ROOM_3_1,"As you enter the Great Oak’s room, you see a giant winged demon swooping around and desperately clawing at the walls of the room."
SCENARIO_STORY_WingedHorror_ROOM_3_2,"Unless you stop it, it’s going to bring the School down on top of you, one way or another."
SCENARIO_STORY_WingedHorror_ROOM_3_3,"When it notices you, the Winged Horror lands before you. “You,” it shrieks, “have kept me and my children outside this realm long enough. You will not survive to save it again!”<br>"
SCENARIO_STORY_WingedHorror_ROOM_3_4,It looks like we have a reputation outside of this realm after all.
SCENARIO_STORY_WingedHorror_ROOM_3_5,"I’ll have to raise our rates, once my ears stop bleeding. "
SCENARIO_STORY_WingedHorror_Room_2_1,"As you push on through the School’s occupiers, a hellish, high-pitched screeching shakes the walls. “I am returned, humans,” it warbles. “You will know nothing but pain!”<br>"
SCENARIO_STORY_WingedHorror_Room_2_2,Sounds like you’re getting close.
SCENARIO_STORY_WingedHorror_Room_2_3,Yeah. Ow. Please kill it before it screams again.
SCENARIO_STORY_WingedHorror_START_1,"It is a mostly forgotten fact, but the Great Oak’s room in the School’s centre holds up the entire School. If that room falls, the School falls."
SCENARIO_STORY_WingedHorror_START_2,"And remember, without the School, no one will buy all the weird magical things we find in crypts. Think of the profit cuts!"
SCENARIO_STORY_WingedHorror_START_3,Just focus on getting past these guards as fast as possible. There is no time to waste. <br>
SCENARIO_STORY_WingedHorror_SUCCESS_1,"The giant demon screeches again, and all the demons and imps around it dematerialize. The Horror’s screams and limbs flail uncontrollably as it succumbs to its wounds.<br>"
SCENARIO_STORY_WingedHorror_SUCCESS_2,"Eventually, it quiets down to a whimper. “Beaten by a human,” it wails. “I feel…” With a retch, it vomits up a solid lump, then lies still."
SCENARIO_STORY_WingedHorror_SUCCESS_3,"You look around in shock, and see that any remaining Inox have already fled, and that the Sawbones is tending to the School’s wounded as if the Horror didn’t exist."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_AMBERHILL_START_1,Closed to outsiders? Who do they think they are?
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_AMBERHILL_START_2,"Well, I guess we know why the traders never came back..."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_AMBERHILL_START_3,"They clearly aren’t going to let you go. Take them down, and then we can investigate further."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_AMBERHILL_SUCCESS_1,"With the Militia dead, the townspeople begin to emerge from their homes."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_AMBERHILL_SUCCESS_2,The villagers have told me that this Militia came to Amberhill from Millpond. That town could be in even more trouble… we should head there next.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_BLACKROCKASYLUM_ROOM_3_1,More Demons! These ones are capable of creating the tremors in the area!
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_BLACKROCKASYLUM_ROOM_3_2,It looks as if you may be able to use the remaining escapees to help take them down.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_BLACKROCKASYLUM_Room_2_1,"This room has more escapees, but you hear the sound of combat coming from behind the next door."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_BLACKROCKASYLUM_Room_2_2,Maybe someone else is helping round up the criminals.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_BLACKROCKASYLUM_Room_2_3,"There is Rubble everywhere in here. Careful, it’ll slow you down."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_BLACKROCKASYLUM_START_1,"We’re not going back in there, you’ll have to kill us first!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_BLACKROCKASYLUM_START_2,I guess you’ll have to do what the man says.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_BLACKROCKASYLUM_SUCCESS_1,"As the Earth Demons fall back to rubble, workers from the asylum come to take away the bodies of those that tried to escape."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_BLACKROCKASYLUM_SUCCESS_2,In the corner of the chamber you find some more of the strange crystals.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_BLOODFORD_Room_2,"The smell is worse in here, there are even more of them!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_BLOODFORD_START_1,"Well this stench can only mean one thing: Living Corpses! They are big and hit hard, but boy are they slow."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_BLOODFORD_START_2,"Oh, they also have a fondness for vomiting... Keep on your toes and hit them from range and you should be fine."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_BLOODFORD_SUCCESS,"The last of the Undead falls to the floor, and the curse on this place is lifted. "
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_BONESHATTERPASS_Room_2_1,You enter the next chamber and floating in front of you is a Savvas
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_BONESHATTERPASS_Room_2_2,The Savvas have put up with lesser races for too long.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_BONESHATTERPASS_Room_2_3,"You encroach on our land, use our resources, and defile our temples."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_BONESHATTERPASS_Room_2_4,We say No More!
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_BONESHATTERPASS_Room_2_5,I can feel the power of the crystals emanating from nearby rooms. Your task is to destroy them. Try not to be distracted with this Savvas!
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_BONESHATTERPASS_START_1,You awake on the floor of a chamber. Demons are advancing towards you.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_BONESHATTERPASS_START_2,"You’ll need to press forwards, there is no way back here!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_BONESHATTERPASS_SUCCESS_1,"As the last Crystal is smashed to pieces, the Demons dissipate, and any remaining Savvas flee."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_BONESHATTERPASS_SUCCESS_2,One step closer to destroying this Savvas sect!
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_CRYSTALHOLLOW_Room_2_1,Lurkers again? Why are they so interested in our water?
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_CRYSTALHOLLOW_Room_2_2,"Whatever it is, they aren’t going to get it for free!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_CRYSTALHOLLOW_Room_2_3,"You’d try and sell anything, I mean, water IS free!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_CRYSTALHOLLOW_Room_2_4,"Stick it in a flask, put a name on it, and idiots will buy anything!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_CRYSTALHOLLOW_Room_4_1,Would you look at all of that Rot?
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_CRYSTALHOLLOW_Room_4_2,"Why would I, when I can smell it?"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_CRYSTALHOLLOW_Room_4_3,"You know the drill. If we clear the area of enemies, the Rot should stop polluting the water."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_CRYSTALHOLLOW_Room_4_4,And then we’ll never come back?
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_CRYSTALHOLLOW_Room_4_5,And then we’ll work out where the creatures came from. And then we’ll never come back.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_CRYSTALHOLLOW_START_1,Look at all of those horrible Oozes… I can’t wait until we get rid of this blasted Rot!
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_CRYSTALHOLLOW_START_2,"At least they’re not stone golems, right?"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_CRYSTALHOLLOW_START_3,Stop. Don’t even say those words.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_CRYSTALHOLLOW_SUCCESS_1,"As the last Ooze dribbles into a puddle, the Rot around the cave crumbles away and the water clears."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_CRYSTALHOLLOW_SUCCESS_2,"But the rotten stench stays, and streaks of black are still visible in the water..."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_CRYSTALHOLLOW_SUCCESS_3,"It appears this wasn’t the source. We’ll have to travel further south, and hopefully we’ll learn of the Lurkers’ plans on the way."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_DEMONSPINEHOLLOW_START_1,"As you pass through a clearing, hounds burst out of the undergrowth followed by high pitched laughing. It seems the villagers were right!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_DEMONSPINEHOLLOW_START_2,Imps! We never believed the elders of my clan when they said they used to deal with fairies.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_DEMONSPINEHOLLOW_START_3,"The world must be in dire straights if they have become this brazen. Beware their magic, an Imp’s curse is not to be taken lightly!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_DEMONSPINEHOLLOW_START_4,"Also, some scenarios have branching paths. In this case it seems there are two routes. Ensure you always investigate all doors — you may need to split the party."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_DEMONSPINEHOLLOW_SUCCESS,"With the Imps and Hounds dead, the colours of the forest return to normal, and you head on towards the village."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_DRAKEFIREFARM_START_1,"I’ve been hearing rumours of Night Demons prowling areas to the north, but this is the first time I’ve seen them in the flesh."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_DRAKEFIREFARM_START_2,"They use the power of the Dark, Light will help you defeat them!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_DRAKEFIREFARM_START_3,"Or cold, hard steel... but beware, they give all attackers disadvantage on their attacks!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_DRAKEFIREFARM_SUCCESS_1,"I hate those things, they're like overgrown spiders... why do they have so many arms?"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_DRAKEFIREFARM_SUCCESS_2,"More arms mean more claws, and more claws means more killing."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_DRAKEFIREFARM_SUCCESS_3,"That was a rhetorical question, but thanks, I’ll sleep soundly tonight..."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_EAGLECREST_START_1,"Ah, what these friendly Inox didn’t inform us was that the Demons have bent the local Forest Imps to their cause. This will be an unpleasant fight."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_EAGLECREST_SUCCESS_1,"With the Demons dead, the Imps in the area flee and the Inox begin returning to their homes."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_EAGLECREST_SUCCESS_2,"I’d hope that’s the last we’ll see of the Sun Demons, but I know that won’t be the case."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_EASTGROVE_ROOM_3,"Here are where the last of the Cultists reside. Kill them, and the creatures should dissipate."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_EASTGROVE_START_1,"The cavern is guarded by Demons and Spirits, but you must venture forth to help the inhabitants of Eastgrove."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_EASTGROVE_SUCCESS_1,"As the final Cultist dies, their hold over the Demons and Spirits are broken, and the Crypt falls silent."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_FORDINGBRIDGE_ROOM_3_1,"This deeper part of the cave is certainly hotter than the others, with molten areas of rock on the walls."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_FORDINGBRIDGE_ROOM_3_2,"Careful, it looks like some of the floor is super-heated and dangerous.."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_FORDINGBRIDGE_ROOM_3_3,"Avoid it yourself, but it can be used like traps to injure or kill any non-flying enemies!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_FORDINGBRIDGE_ROOM_4_1,Demons! What are these ones though? They seem entirely created from fire!
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_FORDINGBRIDGE_ROOM_4_2,I have read of these. Flame Demons. They have not been seen in these parts before... what has brought them here?
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_FORDINGBRIDGE_START_1,"The initial cavern you enter feels similar to many you have seen before, although the colours feel a little strange."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_FORDINGBRIDGE_START_2,"As you investigate, you disturb a number of creatures that live here. You’ll need to dispatch them and head into a deeper part of the hillside."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_FORDINGBRIDGE_SUCCESS_1,"With the Demons dead, the lava begins to cool. You also find some of those mysterious crystals scattered around the cavern."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_FORDINGBRIDGE_SUCCESS_2,Someone or something is using these crystals to sow chaos across the land... but why?
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_HAMMERHOLM_START_1,"You enter the tomb and see hooded figures performing rites… Cultists! No, they carry swords and shields, Bandits…"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_HAMMERHOLM_START_2,"These Bandits have access to powerful magic, I can see they have opened portals through which necromantic energies are flowing."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_HAMMERHOLM_START_3,"Ignore the undead if you can, you must kill all the Bandits to stop the rite!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_HAMMERHOLM_SUCCESS_1,"With the magic users dead, the portals close and the undead turn to dust."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_HAMMERHOLM_SUCCESS_2,"Their power is extinguished, and their hold on this town broken!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_HOUNDHILL_Room_2_1,"Whew, I can’t believe something that ugly actually has friends."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_HOUNDHILL_Room_2_2,"We can’t let any escape, you’ll have to take them all out!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_HOUNDHILL_START_1,That Harrower seemed to be in command of these soldiers…
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_HOUNDHILL_START_2,Wow. Imagine being bossed around by a cloud of bugs!
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_HOUNDHILL_START_3,"But it also seems to be alone here. If you can kill this one too, we may learn more about what it's doing here."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_HOUNDHILL_START_4,You’d also likely break up this merry little gathering!
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_HOUNDHILL_SUCCESS_1,"As the last cloak falls to the ground, the soldiers around you begin to pull back."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_HOUNDHILL_SUCCESS_2,Harrowers commanding Milita? We may be in grave danger...
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_HOUNDHILL_SUCCESS_3,"There’s always some grave danger in this damn place! Where’s the fluffy danger? The harmless, fluffy danger?"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_IRONBELL_Room_2_1,"Well, I guess Drakes and Hounds explain a smell that bad. But I was banking on the Harrowers… or my ex."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_IRONBELL_Room_2_2,"Choose your moves carefully, these are tough enemies!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_IRONBELL_START_1,They intercepted us before we reached Ironbell. We can’t let them reach those forges.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_IRONBELL_START_2,"You know, for a bunch of bugs under a cloak, Harrowers move pretty damn fast."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_IRONBELL_START_3,"However fast they are, they don’t look like they came prepared for a proper fight. You should be able to push them back from the city."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_IRONBELL_SUCCESS_1,"As the last soldier falls, silence returns to the walls of Ironbell."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_IRONBELL_SUCCESS_2,"Ironbell is saved, and has pledged to arm our mercenaries. We just need a way to get them into Keyport now."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_IRONBELL_SUCCESS_3,I can’t wait to go and tell this Council how bad their name is.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_IRONWOODCAMP_START_1,"It sounds as if the forest itself is alive, the cracks of branches and snaps of twigs coming from all around you. You are surrounded!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_IRONWOODCAMP_START_2,"I’ve no idea what’s got all these creatures so angry, but I think you are going to need to kill a decent number to drive them away!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_IRONWOODCAMP_SUCCESS_1,"As another creature falls, the remaining beasts turn tail and flee, and the forest is silent again. You wonder if it is permanent."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_IRONWOODCAMP_SUCCESS_2,"Well, the job is done. Hopefully they won’t return."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_KAILEJ_Room_2_1,"I would quite like it if Deep Terrors stayed in the deep, DEEP sea!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_KAILEJ_Room_2_2,I’m considering filling in the sewers under Demonsgate...
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_KAILEJ_Room_2_3,We have plumbing!? I always went outside…
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_KAILEJ_Room_2_4,...We’ll discuss that later.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_KAILEJ_START_1,This seems just like the situation at Sweetwater.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_KAILEJ_START_2,"With these Inox, though, it might just be a fair fight. As long as we don’t go near the sewers."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_KAILEJ_START_3,Take back this settlement. You know what to do.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_KAILEJ_SUCCESS_1,"The last Deep Terror recedes back into the sewer in pain, and the Inox shout their victory. They commend your bravery."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_KAILEJ_SUCCESS_2,"Kailej’s chieftain says the river’s source is at Crystal Hollow, up in the mountains."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_KAILEJ_SUCCESS_3,"If we promise to destroy the birthplace of this Rot, he’ll stop anything following us there. Sound good?"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_KEYPORT_Room_2_1,There’s the last artillery emplacement!
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_KEYPORT_Room_2_2,We cannot allow the Council’s work to fail. Kill them!
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_KEYPORT_Room_3_1,"Oi, someone order some crushed bugs?"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_KEYPORT_Room_3_2,There’s your reinforcements. Now push to the Council!
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_KEYPORT_Room_5_1,Those are the doors to the City Hall. Push through!
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_KEYPORT_Room_5_2,"Yes, just battle that Stone Golem as well as all these friendly Militia soldiers. Easy."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_KEYPORT_Room_6_1,There’s just a few Harrowers here!? This council actually was bug-brained…
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_KEYPORT_Room_6_2,Why do you fight the Council of Shadow? We are bettering you all!
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_KEYPORT_Room_6_3,Clear out this hive. I fear there is more to this.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_KEYPORT_START_1,"You’ve been discovered, but no matter. You need to destroy this artillery."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_KEYPORT_START_2,Let’s just hope this is all the Militia will throw at you… I’ve seen enough Stone Golems for a lifetime.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_KEYPORT_START_3,"Either way, you wouldn’t be the one fighting them."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_KEYPORT_START_4,"Yes, but they’re scary!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_KEYPORT_SUCCESS_1,"The last Harrower dies, and an uneasy silence falls over the scenes of carnage around Keyport."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_KEYPORT_SUCCESS_2,"It is quickly interrupted by a banging from inside the City Hall. Investigating, you find the Keyport Elders, tied up inside their office."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_KEYPORT_SUCCESS_3,"The Keyport Council told me that Harrowers from The Council of Shadow came from Staybright Fort, and placed their own soldiers into Keyport’s City Guard."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_KEYPORT_SUCCESS_4,"The Council of Shadow, eh? That name is even worse."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_KEYPORT_SUCCESS_5,"Whoever they are, we’ll have to dig them out."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_LOWTOWN_SM1_DESC,"At the Start of each round, the Earth Element is set to Strong"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_LOWTOWN_START_1,"You find the source of the power, a number of ancient stones which the Imps and Vermling Shaman are using in a ritual."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_LOWTOWN_START_2,This will surely end very badly for Lowtown if you don’t drive the Imps away.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_LOWTOWN_START_3,"Earth Magic is strong here, and will always be available at the start of the turn. Use this to your advantage!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_LOWTOWN_SUCCESS,"As the last enemy falls, the pressure in the air immediately abates, the light returns to normal. and the insects of the forest start up again. Your work here is done."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_MILLPOND_Room_3_1,"There’s the Artillery! Give it all you’ve got, and get out of there!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_MILLPOND_Room_3_2,"Protect this equipment with your lives, men! The Council demands it!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_MILLPOND_START_1,All this equipment… Why would Keyport put this much money into military ordnance outside its own walls?
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_MILLPOND_START_2,The artillery should be deeper in town. You’ll have to fight your way to it.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_MILLPOND_START_3,"Without the Artillery, the Militia should lose morale and retreat!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_MILLPOND_SUCCESS_1,"You escape with your lives, leaving the artillery a pile of scrap in your wake."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_MILLPOND_SUCCESS_2,"Good job. Without that artillery, it looks like the troops in Millpond are pulling back. The town will be free again."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_MILLPOND_SUCCESS_3,"Won’t Keyport’s defenses be a little more… prickly? They’ll be protecting their damn council, after all."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_MILLPOND_SUCCESS_4,"There is no way we can get through defenses like that into Keyport. We’re going to need more troops, and I might know just where to find them..."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_MISTFELLCOPSE_START_1,The clearing outside the cairns has Demons waiting for you... but there are no Savvas.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_MISTFELLCOPSE_START_2,There are two chambers to explore. You may need to split up if you want to complete the dungeon quickly enough.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_MISTFELLCOPSE_START_3,"Yes, it looks like there may be crystals in both directions."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_MISTFELLCOPSE_SUCCESS_1,"With the Altars destroyed and Savvas defeated, any remaining Demons dissipate."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_MISTFELLCOPSE_SUCCESS_2,"Once the two sites are cleansed, the Savvas will be badly weakened."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_MUDVIEW_Room_2_1,Focus on those Demon Altars — a lack of Demons will make mopping up the Cultists easier!
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_MUDVIEW_Room_2_2,"After that, the door ahead looks like a shortcut out."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_MUDVIEW_Room_3_1,Oh... Not really a shortcut.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_MUDVIEW_Room_3_2,"Nope. Just Militia and… wait, what is that? A floating cloak?"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_MUDVIEW_Room_3_3,You are a fool for resisting the Council and their gifts!
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_MUDVIEW_Room_3_4,"It’s a Harrower, what's that doing here?"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_MUDVIEW_START_1,These Cultists have been proving to be a real problem for the town.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_MUDVIEW_START_2,I was wondering how people running around in bathrobes were such a nuisance… but the Demons explain it.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_MUDVIEW_START_3,"Clear them out, and the mayor will agree to fight with us."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_MUDVIEW_SUCCESS_1,"As the Harrower is slain, its body disintegrates into a cloud of insects. "
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_MUDVIEW_SUCCESS_2,I haven’t seen many Harrowers this deep in human territory...
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_MUDVIEW_SUCCESS_3,It seemed to be working for that dodgy council… talk about corrupted politicians.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_MUDVIEW_SUCCESS_4,"Whatever it was doing here, it spooked the mayor into providing supplies and safe routes to help us attack Keyport."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_NASITRA_START_1,"Looks like you’ve taken this detachment of archers by surprise, do as much damage as you can before they regroup."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_NASITRA_START_2,You’ll need to kill enough of them to break the siege. Charge!!
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_NASITRA_SUCCESS,"Phew, that was a major battle, but the siege on the Bridge is now lifted. We’re almost at the coast!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_NOMADCAMP_START_1,"I don’t think there’s anything you could do to get me within ten feet of a Lurker, let alone work with one..."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_NOMADCAMP_START_2,Inox and Lurkers working together? This is worrying.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_NOMADCAMP_START_3,"Well, I suppose we should save these nomads so they can pay u— er, help us solve this mystery of course!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_NOMADCAMP_SUCCESS_1,"With the last Inox’s blood soaking into the sand, the nomads approach you with thanks and information."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_NOMADCAMP_SUCCESS_2,"They say the Lurkers made a deal with the Inox: help them recover the teeth from the nomads, and they won’t attack Kailej."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_NOMADCAMP_SUCCESS_3,"Looks like the teeth are now ours, but the attack on Kailej was never called off."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_OBSIDIANBLUFF_Room_3_1,Night Demons? Really?
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_OBSIDIANBLUFF_Room_3_2,I wonder how the Rot is spawning Demons… It might even be able to spawn a—
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_OBSIDIANBLUFF_Room_3_3,No.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_OBSIDIANBLUFF_START_1,Was that some kind of... ritual?
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_OBSIDIANBLUFF_START_2,"Somehow, there’s something even more insane than Cultists? I hate this job. Oh, why does it have to pay so well?"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_OBSIDIANBLUFF_START_3,No one’s going to pay us anything until we put a stop to the Rot. Push through!
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_OBSIDIANBLUFF_SUCCESS_1,"With the dungeon cleared of threats, you’re now able to search it."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_OBSIDIANBLUFF_SUCCESS_2,It appears that the Lurkers and Deep Terrors were indeed performing a ritual with the teeth to summon… something to create the Rot.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_OBSIDIANBLUFF_SUCCESS_3,"But try as I might, I can’t find out what these teeth are from, or what they are ultimately trying to summon. I don’t think this is over just yet…"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_RIVERSRISE_START_1,"You enter the first chamber to see a number of floating, burning figures, and apparently what was left of the villagers who entered the tomb before you has been ‘recruited’ into their service."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_RIVERSRISE_START_2,"Oooh, Sun Demons. Now I’ve never encountered these before, though I have read manuals on how to fight them."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_RIVERSRISE_START_3,"They are extremely accurate, so prevent damage if you can. Try and consume any Light Elements they create!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_RIVERSRISE_SUCCESS_1,"Great work! After all the battles I’ve seen you take part in, I’ll be able to write my own tactical manual some day."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_ROCKFALL_START_1,"There is no sign of the Savvas, so we’ll just have to take down the Demons first."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_ROCKFALL_START_2,"Beware, the Elements have been strengthened here and these Demons could have extra powers!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_ROCKFALL_SUCCESS_1,"The Demons are destroyed, and the villagers of Rockfall begin to venture back out of their homes."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SAHMYRT_ROOM_3_1,"Ah, here we are, the cause of the problem: blasted Vermling Shamans. They can curse your whole party and heal their allies, if you can, take them down fast!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SAHMYRT_Room_2_1,Have they got… Giant Snakes?
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SAHMYRT_Room_2_2,"Certainly looks like it — watch out, those things can jump!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SAHMYRT_START_1,"You reach the village and see Vermlings, armed with bows and arrows, commanding animals."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SAHMYRT_SUCCESS,"The main area around the trade route is now clear, although many Vermlings have retreated into deeper parts of the forest."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SALTMARSHFLATS_Room_2_1,"That looks like the last of the Artillery there. Destroy that, mop up the stragglers, and we should be able to leave without too much trouble."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SALTMARSHFLATS_Room_3_1,"You just HAD to jinx it, didn’t you?"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SALTMARSHFLATS_Room_3_2,"Well, I guess a Cultist presence makes sense in a town built by magicians."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SALTMARSHFLATS_Room_3_3,Why do the Cultists always work with people trying to kill us?
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SALTMARSHFLATS_Room_3_4,Because we aren’t the ones planning a magical world domination?
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SALTMARSHFLATS_Room_3_5,Yeah… I suppose that makes sense. Watch out for those Demons!
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SALTMARSHFLATS_START_1,"Well, this feels awfully familiar…"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SALTMARSHFLATS_START_2,"It does, but this force is much smaller than the stockpile at Millpond."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SALTMARSHFLATS_START_3,Let’s just hope they aren’t hiding anything nasty… like hidden taxes.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SALTMARSHFLATS_START_4,"Destroy the Militia presence here, but be careful. There’s probably more in store than hidden taxes."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SALTMARSHFLATS_SUCCESS_1,"A weight lifts from the air as the last Cultist falls, but the stench of Harrower lingers."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SALTMARSHFLATS_SUCCESS_2,"With the battle over, you notice that Militia and Cultist bodies are not the only ones among the dead."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SALTMARSHFLATS_SUCCESS_3,It looks like the Harrowers killed anyone that wouldn’t join them. I’ll bet these people weren’t even asked nicely!
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SALTMARSHFLATS_SUCCESS_4,We can not allow The Council of Shadow to kill any more people. We need to move now
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SCHOOLOFTHEGREATOAK_SM1_DESC,At the Start of each round All Elements are set to Inert.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SCHOOLOFTHEGREATOAK_START_1,The combination of demonic influence and necromancy has nullified all other magic in the area.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SCHOOLOFTHEGREATOAK_START_2,"All Elements will be set to null at the end of every turn, so you won’t be able to rely on your more powerful magic in this fight!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SCHOOLOFTHEGREATOAK_SUCCESS_1,"As the last enemy is destroyed, you see the rot begin to withdraw, and your magic fires back to life."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SCHOOLOFTHEGREATOAK_SUCCESS_2,"I’d hope that’s the last we’ll see of the Night Demons, but I know that won’t be the case."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SCURVYBAY_Room_2_1,The Harrowers have grouped up with some Savvas here — you’ll have to be extra careful.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SCURVYBAY_START_1,There’s something so… deliciously wrong about this whole situation. It’s just like committing tax fraud.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SCURVYBAY_START_2,"Yes, I can see the irony. You’ll have to fight alongside the bandits today!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SCURVYBAY_START_3,Wait… how do you know what committing tax fraud is like?
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SCURVYBAY_START_4,"Oh I’m, er, imagining of course."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SCURVYBAY_SUCCESS_1,"The bandits stare at you as the last Militia soldier falls. They seem to have accepted you, for now."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SCURVYBAY_SUCCESS_2,"Well, they have agreed to join our cause for revenge. Good work, we have our army."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SCURVYBAY_SUCCESS_3,We just need to get them something sharp to wave about so we can stop this Council doing the thing it’s doing.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SHADEREST_START_1,"Ah, Cultists. They may look relatively harmless at first glance, but you need to eliminate them as soon as possible as they have the ability to raise the undead."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SHADEREST_START_2,"That said, if mortally wounded they can die in the process!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SHADEREST_START_3,"Also, be aware that due to the powerful energies they are invoking, they sometimes have a tendency to explode when killed... so depending on how volatile they are looking, maybe stand back?"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SHADEREST_SUCCESS,"This branch of the Cult is no more, but they are still active in other parts of the realm. This won't be the last you’ll see of them!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SHADOWFIELDMANOR_SM1_DESC,At the Start of each round the Dark Element is set to Strong and the Light Element is set to Inert
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SHADOWFIELDMANOR_START_1,Dark Power has always been said to warp around this area of the forest. It entirely blots out the power of Light too. Use that to your advantage!
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SHADOWFIELDMANOR_SUCCESS,"The cultists are driven away from the manor, which is now safe again. You are unsure whether this is a good thing or not."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SHIMMERINGSHALLOWS_Room_2_1,"You’re almost to the seaport, and… wait, what’s this?"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SHIMMERINGSHALLOWS_Room_2_2,"The Council will make all in this realm more powerful, and you will not stop them!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SHIMMERINGSHALLOWS_Room_2_3,Looks like the Council have convinced more Savvas to join them. You’ll have to deal with them too.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SHIMMERINGSHALLOWS_START_1,"Damn! It looks like this Council of Shadows knew you would come... They work faster than my town council does though, I’ll give them that."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SHIMMERINGSHALLOWS_START_2,"Fortunately this garrison doesn’t look too big, you should be able to retake the seaport yourselves."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SHIMMERINGSHALLOWS_SUCCESS_1,"As the last defender falls, silence falls too, and the port workers slowly appear from their hiding spots."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SHIMMERINGSHALLOWS_SUCCESS_2,I don’t like how organised this Militia is… It almost feels as though Keyport is at war.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SHIMMERINGSHALLOWS_SUCCESS_3,"Thankfully, the townspeople are happy to support us in our attack. We can finally put an end to this Council and their violence."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SILVERWICK_START_1,"You reach a clearing in the forest which contains the entrance to a cave. There are pools of lava and rubble dotted everywhere, you’ll need to mind your step!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SILVERWICK_SUCCESS_1,"With the Demons dead, the route to Silverwick should be clear again."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SOUTHSHIELD_START_1,"A motley group of Vermlings and Inox burst out of the undergrowth, and you can hear more in the distance. Prepare for a large attack!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SOUTHSHIELD_START_2,"This is a rag-tag bunch of enemies. Although there are a lot of them, survive for long enough and they’ll likely lose heart."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SOUTHSHIELD_SUCCESS,"As another enemy falls, the remaining adversaries turn tail and flee, their morale broken. You consider giving chase, but the forest is too dense and getting lost is a definite possibility."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SPITEPEAK_START_1,"As expected, there is a welcoming party for you as you enter the tower."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SPITEPEAK_START_2,Your meddling must come to an end. The Savvas are the master race and will not be polluted by others living here.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SPITEPEAK_START_3,It looks as if more of the doors in this tower are blocked off by pressure plates. You’ll need to be smart to work your way through it.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SPITEPEAK_SUCCESS,"With the Savvas killed, the Demons return to their own realm."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_STAYBRIGHTFORT_Room_2_1,"Ah, Night Demons. That would explain the powerful Dark presence."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_STAYBRIGHTFORT_Room_2_2,"As long as they aren’t Stone Golems, I’m quite happy."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_STAYBRIGHTFORT_Room_2_3,Night Demons and Stone Golems? I don’t think the Council is strong enough to command both!
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_STAYBRIGHTFORT_Room_4_1,I think we may have spoken too soon.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_STAYBRIGHTFORT_Room_4_2,Just kill it. I don’t want to look at it
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_STAYBRIGHTFORT_Room_4_3,"Once it’s dead, prepare yourselves. The doors to the keep are on the other side of this room!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_STAYBRIGHTFORT_Room_5_1,I expected the Council of Shadow to be a little more… impressive?
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_STAYBRIGHTFORT_Room_5_2,"You have stood in the way of our gifts long enough, vermin. Your interference ends here."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_STAYBRIGHTFORT_Room_5_3,"You must make sure it is their interference that ends here, not ours!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_STAYBRIGHTFORT_SM1_DESC,At the Start of each round the Dark Element is set to Strong and the Light Element is set to Inert
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_STAYBRIGHTFORT_START_1,Both groups should clear a way to the keep; you’re going to need all your strength to defeat the Council.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_STAYBRIGHTFORT_START_2,You’d think such a strong Council would have stronger walls on their hideout…
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_STAYBRIGHTFORT_START_3,"They did drain the Light out of this place, though. Be careful: Light is Null here, and Dark is Strong."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_STAYBRIGHTFORT_SUCCESS_1,"Now the Council are dead, you notice the scattered documents around their keep."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_STAYBRIGHTFORT_SUCCESS_2,It seems from these documents that the Council believed controlling the population would have caused less wars.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_STAYBRIGHTFORT_SUCCESS_3,You mean these stinking clouds actually thought they were helping?
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SUMMERWELL_Room_2_1,The temperature in here is even lower than outside!
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SUMMERWELL_Room_2_2,Frost Demons! They must be the cause of the Blizzard. You need to destroy them!
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SUMMERWELL_START_1,"It seems a family of bears and some hounds have taken shelter, and they are not happy to see you!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SUMMERWELL_START_2,"If we are stuck here for any time, we’ll need to deal with these creatures and anything else in the rest of the network of caves."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SUMMERWELL_SUCCESS_1,The last Frost Demon falls and the temperature of the cave instantly rises to simply ‘cold’.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SUMMERWELL_SUCCESS_2,"As expected, crystals lie scattered in the rear part of the cave. It seems the Savvas were expecting you to follow on this route."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SWEETWATER_Room_2_1,Deep Terrors too?
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SWEETWATER_Room_2_2,Watch out for… whatever it is they do!
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SWEETWATER_Room_3_1,How did the smell get WORSE!?
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SWEETWATER_Room_3_2,It seems like some kind of... Rot blocking the sewage — hopefully killing these creatures will clear it.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SWEETWATER_START_1,"Well, this is nothing like the paintings."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SWEETWATER_START_2,Are those… Black Imps?
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SWEETWATER_START_3,They look like living sewage!
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SWEETWATER_SUCCESS_1,"With the creatures dead, the Rot shrivels away and the sewage begins to flow properly again. In the rot’s place, spoiled spring water seeps through cracks in the sewer walls."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SWEETWATER_SUCCESS_2,"I think the source of this rot runs deeper. Have a wash, and we’ll investigate further."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SWEETWATER_SUCCESS_3,"Whatever this rot is, I’m not going anywhere near a sewer again."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_TEMPLEOFTHEACORN_SM1_DESC,All enemies have Poison added to their Attacks
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_TEMPLEOFTHEACORN_START_1,These dogs look diseased. Be aware they have POISON on all their attacks.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_TEMPLEOFTHEACORN_START_2,"I’m pretty sure that if you can survive long enough, they’ll turn tail and run."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_TEMPLEOFTHEACORN_SUCCESS_1,"Unable to break your resolve, the remaining hounds slink into the shadows and leave the tomb, scattering into the desert beyond."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_TEMPLEOFTHEACORN_SUCCESS_2,Poisonous Hounds are even worse than normal Hounds... why don’t people just own a cat like I do?
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEBARRENCOAST_START_1,"As expected, out of the bushes stomp some very angry-looking Inox. You try to communicate with them, but to no avail. They prepare to attack."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEBARRENCOAST_START_2,"It seems some of my less cultured cousins are going to mess with your day. Treat Inox as big angry humans — they aren’t too difficult to take down, unless they bring their Shaman along."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEBARRENCOAST_SUCCESS,"With the tribe defeated, your path from the forest is no longer barred. You continue to the Barren Coast."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEBURIEDTRENCHES_Room_3_1,"That looks like the same Rot we found in Sweetwater, but it doesn’t appear to be the source."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEBURIEDTRENCHES_Room_3_2,It stinks the same. Do you think these creatures travel through the Rot?
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEBURIEDTRENCHES_Room_3_3,"Maybe… but they are definitely connected. Finish clearing the reservoir, and we’ll investigate further."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEBURIEDTRENCHES_START_1,"Well, there’s no doubt that these reservoirs are contaminated too."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEBURIEDTRENCHES_START_2,"I thought Oozes were just tall tales made up by drunken idiots, wrong again!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEBURIEDTRENCHES_START_3,"The Rot’s source is likely further inside. Push through, and watch the Oozes — they spread fast."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEBURIEDTRENCHES_SUCCESS_1,"With the Rot cleared, the stench of stale water dominates. The reservoir stays dirty."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEBURIEDTRENCHES_SUCCESS_2,"A southern river feeds this reservoir. It passes by the Inox settlement of Kailej, so we’ll head in that direction."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THECITYOFSLATE_START_1,"Well, this is new to me... Undead with flaming bows?"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THECITYOFSLATE_START_2,It looks as if their arrow heads may be explosive. Try and split up if possible!
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THECITYOFSLATE_SUCCESS,"It seems they return to the dust like any other Undead. Now, let’s see what the archaeologists can reward us with!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THECOPPEROASIS_START_1,"The Vermlings have made a simple camp here, and the Oasis is littered with their rubbish. As you step into view, they grab their weapons and attack."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THECOPPEROASIS_SUCCESS,"With the last Vermling dead, the Oasis is a safe place for travellers once more."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEDOME_START_1,"You certainly expected to find Cultists down here, of course in the garb of the Umbran League. What you didn’t expect were Night Demons!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEDOME_START_2,"It seems they are not content with raising the dead, but are now in collusion with Demons. They must be stopped!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEDOME_SUCCESS_1,Peace returns to the Dome after its most recent battle for decades is now over.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEENCLAVE_SM1_DESC,All animals are permanently Strengthened.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEENCLAVE_START_1,"In the first cavern, you find the Mayor’s Hounds locked in cages and quickly free them, using the commands he taught you to ensure they don’t attack."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEENCLAVE_START_2,"Just then, Bandits come in from another Cavern."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEENCLAVE_START_3,"‘Who are you lot? Oh bugger, they’ve let those Hounds free! Quick, get them!’"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEENCLAVE_START_4,Bandits and other animals come into the cavern. It looks like you’ll have to fight your way out.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEENCLAVE_START_5,"All the animals here seem to be acting strangely. I think they’ve been injected with something. You better look after those Hounds too — if they don’t make it, the Mayor isn’t going to be happy!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEENCLAVE_SUCCESS_1,"It seems the Bandits were trying out a strange elemental magic on these animals, that’s why they were all Strengthened."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEENCLAVE_SUCCESS_2,Better take the Mayor’s Hounds back and get out of here.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEHERMITAGE_START_1,Scientists eh? I’d never mess with necromancy.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEHERMITAGE_START_2,Because you don’t understand magic and are terrified of the undead?
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEHERMITAGE_START_3,"Well, that, and there isn’t a great return on investment. Also, some of the corpses end up looking like a particularly unpleasant uncle I used to have."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEHERMITAGE_SUCCESS,"With the Undead returned to peace, you climb the stairs to the top of the tower to explain to the Quatryl the error of his ways."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEHOLE_START_1,You climb down into the temple. Wind howls down the corridors and there is a bitter chill in the air.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEHOLE_START_2,More Demons. Also the door looks... locked?
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEHOLE_START_3,I believe it’s an ancient Savvas security system. You’ll need to stand on all pressure pads in a room to open the next door.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEHOLE_START_4,Okay. Let’s clear out all the rooms and see what the Savvas wanted here.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEHOLE_SUCCESS,"The Temple is quiet once more, and you take your time looking around for clues."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEPYRE_START_1,"Oh dear, you have awoken some Living Spirits, the souls of those who died suddenly and unhappily."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEPYRE_START_2,Isn’t all death unhappy?
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEPYRE_START_3,"… Spirits have a resistance to damage, so you'll find attacks with Pierce more effective. They also fly, so the Traps won't help!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEPYRE_SUCCESS,"As the sun rises, the undead fall to the ground and you leave the tomb and its terrors. You then pile up stones over the entrance, so that no one else awakens the restless dead."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THESHIFTINGSANDS_Room_3_1,What are Lurkers doing so far from the sea? Is nowhere safe!?
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THESHIFTINGSANDS_Room_3_2,Lurkers are a dangerous and intelligent race… there must be a reason they are going to such lengths for these teeth.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THESHIFTINGSANDS_START_1,There is no Rot here. What has drawn the Black Imps?
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THESHIFTINGSANDS_START_2,Maybe the teeth are important to the Imps?
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THESHIFTINGSANDS_START_3,"Hmm, possibly. Regroup as quickly as you can: there’s no telling what followed the imps here..."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THESHIFTINGSANDS_SUCCESS_1,"As the last Lurker falls into the sand, an uneasy peace falls over the camp."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THESHIFTINGSANDS_SUCCESS_2,Violent Lurkers this far from the ocean’s depths are a bad sign. We must make haste to the Inox.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THESHIFTINGSANDS_SUCCESS_3,"What about the nomads? They might have some mone— I mean, information?"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THESHIFTINGSANDS_SUCCESS_4,"That is true, but it would be a detour. I’d have to consider it further."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THESLOSHEDSQUIRREL_START_1,"What the… Bandits working with Vermlings? These guys are going to have a lot of ranged attacks, best get up close and personal!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THESLOSHEDSQUIRREL_SUCCESS,"As the last bow falls to the ground, you patch your wounds and head off towards the pub."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THETHORNGATE_Room_2,"Entering this cavern, you find the source of the music: a group of Imps generating the magical melody. Although the children are not here, you feel that they are nearby."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THETHORNGATE_SM1_DESC,All Stone Golems Heal for 2 at the end of each turn
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THETHORNGATE_START_1,The cave leads down to a room protected by stone guardians and the air is infused with magic that should boost any Healing abilities.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THETHORNGATE_START_2,"Beware, those Golems have a healing aura on them! You’ll have to work hard to take them down."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THETHORNGATE_SUCCESS_1,"With the last enemy dead, the music abruptly stops and you immediately hear the sounds of voices from the rear of the cavern."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THETHORNGATE_SUCCESS_2,"After a short search, you detect an illusion placed on the area hiding an entranceway to an antechamber with a group of children inside."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THETHORNGATE_SUCCESS_3,"They seem scared, but unharmed. You lead them back to the town"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_TOADMOOR_START_1,"Drakes, this far east? Something must have made them leave the mountains!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_TOADMOOR_START_2,"Beware their poison, and the walking ones have a ferocious set of bites. Attack from range if you can."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_TOADMOOR_SUCCESS,I expect the harsh winter has driven them to forage further for food. Expect more Drake encounters across the realm.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_WAYFARERSREST_START_1,"This is a Bounty mission, which means to succeed you will need to kill a certain number of enemies."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_WAYFARERSREST_START_2,"The good news is that the whole battle will take place in this single clearing, the bad news is that enemies will keep spawning until you kill enough."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_WAYFARERSREST_SUCCESS,"Good Job, I don’t think they’ll be coming back in a hurry!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_WAYFARERSREST_Win_Objective,
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_WAYWARD_START_1,"You raise your eyes and see Imps in the clearing, and something you’ve not encountered before."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_WAYWARD_START_2,"Wind Demons! I should have guessed, with that strange weather..."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_WAYWARD_START_3,It seems someone is trying to stop you reaching Wayward. You’ll need to drive them away.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_WAYWARD_SUCCESS,"As you kill another Wind Demon, the storm picks up again and you cover your eyes. When it abates, you are once again alone."

SOLO_SCENARIO_BRUTE_01,"You sniff the air as you descend the familiar stone steps, and the stale smell of death and decay fills you with anger – an anger focused on yourself. You remember the first time you stepped down into these depths and smelled this odor. It was your first job after you arrived in Gloomhaven. And you remember being scared by it."
SOLO_SCENARIO_BRUTE_02,"You would never have dreamed of exposing your fear to your companions. They were depending on you to lead the charge into your bandit foes. When you’re this big, no one expects you to feel fear, but sometimes it’s inevitable."
SOLO_SCENARIO_BRUTE_03,"Still, your reaction to this place has haunted you ever since. When you began to hear rumors about a powerful weapon hidden in the depths of the Black Barrow, you jumped at the opportunity to return and face its dangers alone."
SOLO_SCENARIO_BRUTE_04,"You are stronger now – more seasoned. Walking down these steps no longer fills you with dread, only excitement. You hope that more pathetic bandits have made this place their home since the last time you charged through these dark halls."
SOLO_SCENARIO_BRUTE_05,You reach the bottom of the steps and bash open the door. You are not disappointed.
SOLO_SCENARIO_BRUTE_06,"Despite your numerous wounds, you press on into the final room. Everything is exactly as you remember – smug bandits and animated bones."
SOLO_SCENARIO_BRUTE_07,"You shouldn't have come...' An archer begins to talk, but you silence her with a dismissive wave of your hand. These fools aren’t important enough to waste your time with speeches."
SOLO_SCENARIO_BRUTE_08,"You limp toward the stairs at the back of the room and can’t help but let out a bellowing laugh. You are unstoppable, a force to be reckoned with."
SOLO_SCENARIO_BRUTE_09,"Trailing blood, you make your way into the lower catacombs, looking for the telltale clues of your quarry. Perhaps it is luck, or perhaps the rest of the bandits were terrified of your laughter, but either way, you find the sword and leave without further incident."

Scenario_Campaign_001_Room_3_1,"Kicking through the door, you find yourself face-to-face with the reason these bandits chose this particular hole to nest in: animate bones—unholy abominations of necromantic power."
Scenario_Campaign_001_Room_3_2,Nothing more to do but lay them to rest along with the remainder of this troublesome rabble.
Scenario_Campaign_001_Start_1,"“Take care of these unfortunates,” your target says, backing out of the room. You can vaguely make out his silhouette as he retreats down a hallway and through a door to his left."
Scenario_Campaign_001_Start_2,"“Well, it’s not every day we get people stupid enough to hand-deliver their valuables to us,” grins one of the larger bandits, unsheathing a rusty blade. “We’ll be killing you now.”"
Scenario_Campaign_001_Start_3,"Joke’s on them. If you had any valuables, you probably wouldn’t be down here in the first place."
Scenario_Campaign_001_Success_1,"With the last bandit dead, you take a moment to catch your breath and steel yourself against the visions of living remains ripping at your flesh. "
Scenario_Campaign_001_Success_2,"Your target is not among the dead, and you shudder to think what horrors still await you in the catacombs below."
Scenario_Campaign_002_Objective_1,Kill the Bandit Commander
Scenario_Campaign_002_Objective_2,Kill all revealed enemies 
Scenario_Campaign_002_Room_2_1,"You open the door to a large crypt littered with coffins. At the back stands your quarry. He fits the description, but there is something previously unnoticed in his eyes—a dark otherworldly force."
Scenario_Campaign_002_Room_2_2,“Who are you to think you can interrupt the work of the Gloom?” A dark energy engulfs his hands as he speaks. “I will show you what you are dealing with!”
Scenario_Campaign_002_Success_1,"Sifting through the carnage left by the battle, you find a cache at the back of the room containing the scrolls you were hired to collect."
Scenario_Campaign_002_Success_2,"You can’t help but rifle through them a bit, but find that the writing upon them is in some unknown archaic language. "
Scenario_Campaign_002_Success_3,"One thing that does jump out at you, however, is a map of the northern countryside. A bend in the Still River is clearly marked as a point of interest. "
Scenario_Campaign_002_Success_4,"Contemplating whether you want to find out more about this so-called “Gloom,” you decide that the spot could be a point of interest for you, as well.  "
Scenario_Campaign_002_Success_5,But that can be forgotten for the moment. You pack up the papers and head back to Gloomhaven to collect your reward.<br>
Scenario_Campaign_003_Objective_1,Kill a number of enemies equal to five times the number of mercenaries
Scenario_Campaign_003_Room_6_1,"You push your way into the back cave only to be faced with a half-dozen crying, screaming Inox children. "
Scenario_Campaign_003_Room_6_2,"You have little opportunity to contemplate the implications of this development, however, as you find yourself also staring down the bows of several Inox archers. Your only option is to continue fighting."
Scenario_Campaign_003_SCENARIO_MODIFIER_1,The spawner will deactivate once the door next to it is open
Scenario_Campaign_003_Success_1,"Running through the forest, fleeing the smell of burning flesh, you now find more than enough opportunity to contemplate your actions."
Scenario_Campaign_004_Room_3_1,"You bash in the door, thinking you have prepared for anything. Before you, however, stands a creature of pure elemental energy, enraged and demonic. It takes you a second to collect yourself. As if animating the dead wasn't enough for these lunatics. "
Scenario_Campaign_004_Start_1,"""You've made a mistake coming here,"" one of the bandits hisses. You disagree. You are right where you want to be. "
Scenario_Campaign_004_Success_1,"It is clear that you have disrupted some sort of ritual here. These elemental demons belong on an entirely different plane of existence, but the cultists have somehow managed to pull them through to this one."
Scenario_Campaign_004_Success_2,"On the altar in the back room, there is a wealth of scribblings on these rituals. Not all of the writing is intelligible, but you get the sense that this crypt is a place of power once used by an ancient civilization. "
Scenario_Campaign_004_Success_3,"The ancients tapped the power of the elements to enhance their own lives, and while the exact fate is beyond your knowledge, it clearly didn't end well. "
Scenario_Campaign_004_Success_4,Among the scripts you also find notes on a couple of other places of power in the area. One appears to see heavy use with the cult and the other is marked as being overrun by vicious undead. 
Scenario_Campaign_004_Success_5,It looks as though you have the opportunities to either disrupt more of their work or get in their good graces by helping to clear out a threat. 
Scenario_Campaign_005_Success_1,"With the cultists and their minions dead, it seems the dark rift is now dormant. It is not less disconcerting, however. You toss a rock at it, and the rock disappears into nothingness."
Scenario_Campaign_005_Success_2,You must admit that you wonder whether you could enter the rift yourself and whether you could survive the trip to wherever the rock ended up. 
Scenario_Campaign_005_Success_3,"Alternatively, finding some way to close the rift is probably the more prudent decision. There is an Aesther enchanter in Gloomhaven who may know more about this inter-planar stuff. "
Scenario_Campaign_005_Success_4,"She's been known to ask for impossible favours before she helps anyone, though. "
Scenario_Campaign_006_Objective_1,Reach the Treasure Room
Scenario_Campaign_006_Objective_2,Kill all revealed enemies 
Scenario_Campaign_006_Success_1,"After the terrible shrieks and moans of the undead, the sound of someone clapping is at once foreign and alarming. Turning around, you see a hooded figure standing at the edge of your torchlight. "
Scenario_Campaign_006_Success_2,"You raise your weapon, but the grin on his silhouetted face isn’t menacing in a way that calls for arms. It is menacing in a way you’ve never experienced before."
Scenario_Campaign_006_Success_3,"“Well done, sirs,” the figure lilts. “My, my, but you do have a way about you, don’t you? And you’ve certainly gotten our attention now, removing this troublesome crypt of its rogue undead element. We very much prefer our undead to be the controllable variety, now don’t we?”"
Scenario_Campaign_006_Success_4,"There is a long pause as the figure stares at you, still grinning."
Scenario_Campaign_006_Success_5,"“Well, perhaps you’d be so kind as to do us another favor? After which we’ll be mostly settled on the whole issue of you murdering some of my brethren.” He stops grinning.<br>"
Scenario_Campaign_006_Success_6,"“There’s a necromancer in Gloomhaven. Been giving us a spot of trouble, sending mercenaries out to do her dirty work against us. Maybe you’ve met her."" "
Scenario_Campaign_006_Success_7,"“Kill Jekserah. Bring her head to our headquarters, and we’ll see about letting you live."""
Scenario_Campaign_007_Objective_1,Loot all 5 Ornate Chests with a Loot action (not end-of-turn looting)
Scenario_Campaign_007_Success_1,"You pull up the last bush and hack away at its root. The grotto is still alive with many hostile creatures, but with your packs now full of biteroot, you make a quick retreat, eventually finding your way to the Stone Road and back to Gloomhaven and the Crooked Bone."
Scenario_Campaign_008_Objective_1,Kill both Inox Bodyguards 
Scenario_Campaign_008_Objective_2,Search the warehouse's rooms for Jekserah
Scenario_Campaign_008_Room_3_1,"Barreling through the gauntlet of storage shelves, traps, and undead, you finally make it to the back room of the warehouse, face-to-face with Jekserah and her two Inox bodyguards. "
Scenario_Campaign_008_Room_3_2,"""So, you've decided to disrupt my plans instead of help me? You will regret that decision when I return to Gloomhaven with a legion of undead at my back!"""
Scenario_Campaign_008_Room_3_3,"Moving with great speed, Jekserah turns and runs from you, flipping out of a window. You make a move to pursue her, but the two gargantuan Inox block your advance. "
Scenario_Campaign_008_Success_1,"With the battle behind you, you look out the window and see no evidence of the fleeing Valrath. "
Scenario_Campaign_008_Success_2,"You've stopped her plans for now, but after your brief conversation, it is clear that you need to hunt her down before she can make good on her threats. "
Scenario_Campaign_009_Objective_1,Kill the Merciless Overseer
Scenario_Campaign_009_Objective_2,Loot the Ornate Chest 
Scenario_Campaign_009_Room_2_1,You move through a tight crawlspace clearly more suited to the ratlike Vermlings into a large chamber full of rubble and Vermling miners on high alert. 
Scenario_Campaign_009_Room_2_2,"Toward the back of the chamber, a man in a dark robe cracks a whip and begins spitting orders at the miners, who turn their pickaxes away from the stone walls and toward you. "
Scenario_Campaign_009_Success_1,"With the overseer dead and the diamond in your hand, you head back to Jekserah to claim your reward. "
Scenario_Campaign_010_Start_1,"A booming voice fills the crackling air. ""Who are you to slay my servants and invade my realm? This affront will not go unpunished!"""
Scenario_Campaign_010_Start_2,"Before you the energies in the air begin to form vague demonic shapes. To go deeper into this unearthly place, you must fight your way through. "
Scenario_Campaign_010_Success_1,"As the final demon in sight screams and dissipates into the wind, you fall to your knees, thankful that the assault has stopped.  "
Scenario_Campaign_010_Success_2,"""Very interesting."" The voice appears deep inside your head, clawing at your brain with its words. ""You interlopers are unexpectedly powerful. I could certainly use your expertise to find something in your own plane."" "
Scenario_Campaign_010_Success_3,"The red rock below you rumbles and cracks, and a fiery fissure opens at your feet. ""I open my realm to you. Come, let me speak to you face-to-face."""
Scenario_Campaign_010_Success_4,"Having already made one leap of faith this day, you decide there's no harm in making another. The heat grows more intense as you descend, and scalding air billows up from below, slowing your fall.  "
Scenario_Campaign_010_Success_5,"You land quite safely in what appears to be an underground temple. Before you stands a monstrous creature, horned and terrifying, holding a trident and standing on two hooved legs. "
Scenario_Campaign_010_Success_6,"The voice still resonates from inside your head. ""Brave and foolish. You should serve me well. There is an artifact of great power located in a forgotten temple along the Serpent's Kiss river. You can retrieve it for me, or you can die here and now."" "
Scenario_Campaign_011_Objective_1,Kill the Captain of the Guard
Scenario_Campaign_011_Room_4_1,"With the guards’ bodies in your wake stirring and rising as the undead, you knock through the fortress door. "
Scenario_Campaign_011_Room_4_2,"“Today we stand against the darkness!” The Captain of the Guard bellows at you, surrounded by soldiers. “To me! I will not let the city fall to this scum!”"
Scenario_Campaign_011_Start_1,"Jekserah turns to you. “Head to the Ghost Fortress. If the Captain of the Guard falls, any resistance to our new order will fall soon after.” "
Scenario_Campaign_011_Start_2,"She disappears, and you prepare to complete your orders."
Scenario_Campaign_011_Success_1,"The last of the guard falls, and once more you see a transformation of the bodies into soulless walking corpses. Jekserah steps through the doorway behind you."
Scenario_Campaign_011_Success_2,"“You have done well, mercenaries—proved yourself in the face of these relentless pigs. With my bodyguards dead, you will be my new right hand, and we will rule over this city as it was meant to be ruled over. The last remnants of the old empire has finally fallen, and you should be proud."""
Scenario_Campaign_011_Success_3,"“But there is still much work to be done. The merchant guild grows concerned about the declining quality of our water supply. We feel there may be some dark force at work below the sewers, poisoning the city."" "
Scenario_Campaign_011_Success_4,"""I’ve also heard some talk behind closed doors of a dragon making roost in the Copperneck Mountains. Some merchants can be such children, but still, the reports are worth investigating. Whatever it is could be a threat to the city.”"
Scenario_Campaign_012_Objective_1,Kill Jekserah
Scenario_Campaign_012_Room_2_1,"The waves of undead crashing against your weapons have finally subsided as you reach Jekserah’s manor and kick in the door. You see her in the foyer, shaking with rage."
Scenario_Campaign_012_Room_2_2,"“You will not defeat me! My army has been cut back, but the dead are fuel to my fire. My army is infinite and eternal!”"
Scenario_Campaign_012_Room_2_3,Jekserah retreats further into her manor as her undead advance. 
Scenario_Campaign_012_Success_1,"Jekserah collapses, the life fleeing her eyes. “I...” she whispers at you. “You have no idea what’s coming...”"
Scenario_Campaign_012_Success_2,"""Infuriating."" The Captain of the Guard has come to meet you, blood still stains his tunic. “So much needless death, eating ourselves from the inside. At least it is over now.”"
Scenario_Campaign_012_Success_3,"“Listen, you have proven yourself this day. Without your warning and without your strength, we would have been overtaken by the undead. If you’re interested, I may have some more work for you."""
Scenario_Campaign_012_Success_4,"""First of all, we've had reports from the north about large flying creatures. People are afraid of dragons.” He shakes his head in annoyance. “I’d like you to head to the northern pass and investigate."""
Scenario_Campaign_012_Success_5,"“Closer to home, however, there is some trouble brewing in the sewers below the Sinking Market. The wells in the area seem to be poisoned, and the sewers have become infested with snakes and sentient slimes, making further investigation difficult. I need you to discover the source of the poison.”  "
Scenario_Campaign_013_Room_2_1,"You open the door to the inner chamber, and more enemies materialize before you eyes. Flying red lizards, wailing spirits, and great, terrifying bears that don't seem at all happy to have been suddenly transported here. "
Scenario_Campaign_013_Start_1,"""I know, I know,"" the voice says. ""You have questions, I have answers. Unfortunately, if you don't leave now, you won't have a head to ask the questions in the first place."""
Scenario_Campaign_013_Start_2,You ready your weapons. There's no way you're going to climb back down that cliff with nothing to show for it. 
Scenario_Campaign_013_Success_1,"As the last of the creatures falls, the temple becomes eerily silent. You call out, but the strange voice offers no response.  "
Scenario_Campaign_013_Success_2,"You begin banging the walls with your weapons and yelling even louder, making it clear that you will not leave without answers."
Scenario_Campaign_013_Success_3,"""ENOUGH!"" The power of the voice shakes the ground. ""I could easily kill you, you know. But normally a threat is enough to send you pathetic lesser beings scrambling."""
Scenario_Campaign_013_Success_4,"""I don't necessarily like murder, however, so I will make you a deal. I will answer a single question for you, and then you will leave this place without further incident and never return."""
Scenario_Campaign_013_Success_5,"""So what would you like? Great power? Great wealth? Or is the location of the necromancer you are hunting really that important to you?"""
Scenario_Campaign_014_Success_1,"With the last of your adversaries dead, you approach the back of the chamber, where a small blue sphere floats above the floor."
Scenario_Campaign_014_Success_2,"You slowly reach out your hand and find the orb cold to the touch. With a firm grip on it, the temperature is almost unbearable, but you quickly stash it into your pack and make your way back to the Crooked Bone."
Scenario_Campaign_015_Objective_1,Loot the Ornate Chest 
Scenario_Campaign_015_SCENARIO_MODIFIER_1,The single doors leading from the central room will open when the pressure plate in the central room is activated. The double doors will only open once all pressure plates in the rooms behind the single doors have been activated simultaneously. 
Scenario_Campaign_015_Success_1,You rush forward and take hold of the sigil of strength lying on a pedestal in the inner chamber. Immediately an overwhelming power surges through you and all of your foes disappear as quickly as they had appeared. 
Scenario_Campaign_015_Success_2,"You feel a great strength welling up inside you. For an instant, your vision goes dark, and you see glimpses of a strange runic alphabet."
Scenario_Campaign_015_Success_3,"The power dissipates and your vision returns, but before you can write down the symbols they fade from memory."
Scenario_Campaign_016_Room_2_1,"With the pass blocked by the avalanche, you enter the cave to face your aggressors. Inside you see a network of passages leading deep into the mountain. "
Scenario_Campaign_016_Room_2_2,Perhaps they would be worth exploring once your foes are dead. 
Scenario_Campaign_016_Success_1,"What were Inox and demons doing together? And so far north? You rifle through their belongings, looking for some indication of their motivation."
Scenario_Campaign_016_Success_2,"All you find is some crude scratchings referencing a ""voice."" You glance toward the cave. There may be some clues farther down the tunnels.  "
Scenario_Campaign_016_Success_3,"To the north, Icecrag Peak looms large in the distance. Still, you feel something calling you to explore the cave. Not audibly, but there is a subtle and powerful urge. "
Scenario_Campaign_016_Success_4,"You look down at the Inox's scribblings. A voice—yes, somehow that sounds familiar. You can almost hear it yourself."
Scenario_Campaign_017_Room_2_1,"Who knew so many of these damned creatures could exist on such a small island? Entering their dwellings onboard the derelict ship, you see more emerge from the shadows. "
Scenario_Campaign_017_Room_2_2,"Along with them, however, you see the glinting of gold. This tribe has indeed amassed a great wealth in this ship."
Scenario_Campaign_017_Success_1,"With the distraction of flashing swords and swiping claws put to rest, you investigate further to find great caches of gold below deck.  "
Scenario_Campaign_017_Success_2,"Who knows what the Vermlings were using the gold for, but you have a good idea what you will use it for."
Scenario_Campaign_018_Room_3_1,"Navigating through the passageways, you find yourself in a large, open room with a cistern at the center. "
Scenario_Campaign_018_Room_3_2,"Around the cistern stand a group of Vermlings, who look up and snarl in your direction. This must be the cause of the poisoned water. "
Scenario_Campaign_018_Success_1,"The Vermlings lie dead, their dark blood mixing with the pools of water on the floor. "
Scenario_Campaign_018_Success_2,"Invesitgating further, you find no poisons of any kind on the corpses. Is it possible these vermin were not the cause and just living here, away from the eyes of the guard?"
Scenario_Campaign_018_Success_3,"At the back of the room, large cracks are present in the wall, displaying a passage deeper into the depths. "
Scenario_Campaign_018_Success_4,"And if you had some way to breathe underwater, you may even be able to enter the cistern and find the source that way. "
Scenario_Campaign_019_Objective_1,Protect Hail until she reaches the altar
Scenario_Campaign_019_Objective_2,Keep Hail Alive
Scenario_Campaign_019_Room_3_1,"There is no rest among these cursed undead. As you kick through the door into the next room, you hear more commotion from the entrance. “There’s more of them behind us!” Hail yells."
Scenario_Campaign_019_Start_1,"“You shouldn’t have come here, ghostface,” one of the cultists says. "
Scenario_Campaign_019_Start_2,"“Ugh,” Hail sighs. “Dispatch these simpletons quickly. I’m already bored with them.”"
Scenario_Campaign_019_Success_1,"Hail moves forward and grabs hold of the censer. She lifts it aloft and speaks a few words in an unknown language. Fire bursts forth and immolates the remaining undead, reducing them to ash."
Scenario_Campaign_019_Success_2,"Hail breaks the smallest of smiles. “Well, now that that annoyance has been dealt with, let’s get on with the real fun. Show me to this rift of yours.”"
Scenario_Campaign_020_Objective_1,Kill Jekserah
Scenario_Campaign_020_Room_4_1,"Jekserah has unfortunately had ample time to reanimate the corpses here, but they are no match for your skills. You knock down one last door to come face-to-face with the necromancer herself."
Scenario_Campaign_020_Room_4_2,"“I don’t know how you found me, but it matters little. You have mistakenly assumed that I ran because I was afraid to fight you. I was just holding out some hope that you would come to your senses in time."" "
Scenario_Campaign_020_Room_4_3,"""It is a pity that your minds cannot think beyond what is at the end of your blades. What corpses you have destroyed so far will now be replaced with your own.”"
Scenario_Campaign_020_Success_1,"Jekserah collapses, the life fleeing her eyes. “I...” she whispers at you. “You have no idea what’s coming...” "
Scenario_Campaign_020_Success_2,"With one more hack of your blade, you separate her head from her body and hastily leave the wretched place full of mangled corpses. "
Scenario_Campaign_021_Objective_1,Kill the Prime Demon
Scenario_Campaign_021_Room_5_1,"You lift back the veil of darkness to reveal the main room of the palace. In the center, you see the huge demon laughing. "
Scenario_Campaign_021_Room_5_2,"“You should have fled my realm while you had the chance, worms. In this place, you cannot possibly harm me.” "
Scenario_Campaign_021_Room_5_3,"He places a giant, clawed hand upon an altar of black glass in front of him. A swirling rift of chromatic energy emerges and pulses, bathing the demon in an aura of protection."
Scenario_Campaign_021_Success_1,"With one final blow, the rift grows chaotic, spinning wildly and shooting tendrils of energy out at odd angles. A sharp whine emerges from it that increases in intensity until the sound echoes throughout the palace."
Scenario_Campaign_021_Success_2,"In a brilliant flash of light, the void collapses in on itself and then explodes outward, sending a shock wave that destroys all demons in its path."
Scenario_Campaign_021_Success_3,"As the wave hits the Prime Demon, his aura dissipates and a scream pierces your mind. His legs buckle underneath him and he collapses on the floor, crashing into countless shards of stone."
Scenario_Campaign_021_Success_4,"As this happens, the screaming stops and the palace grows oddly quiet. With the threat destroyed, the only sensible thing left to do is loot the place and make your way back to your own plane."
Scenario_Campaign_022_Altar,Elemental Altar
Scenario_Campaign_022_Objective_1,Destroy all altars
Scenario_Campaign_022_Room_2_1,"Moving on from the entrance chamber, you find a large central room with many exits. In the center stands another group of cultists, preparing incantations around a reddish clay vessel, roughly the size of a skull."
Scenario_Campaign_022_Room_2_2,"“The artifact is ours, and it has made our minions more powerful than ever."" The speaking cultist laughs. ""You cannot hope to stop what is coming. Even if you strike us down, the Gloom will bring forth your end."""
Scenario_Campaign_022_Room_2_3,The cultists raise their hands and a barrier surrounds the artifact.
Scenario_Campaign_022_SCENARIO_MODIFIER_1,"Until destroyed, each altar (including unrevealed) increases the maximum hit point and attack stats of all demons by 1, and increases their movement and range stats by 0.5, rounded up. Melee attacks do not increase in range. "
Scenario_Campaign_022_Start_1,"""You’re too late, fools,"" one of the cultists announces. ""We control this temple now, and all its power serves us."""
Scenario_Campaign_022_Success_1,"With the altars smashed, the demons vanish and the protective barrier around the artifact finally dissipates. "
Scenario_Campaign_022_Success_2,"You approach the center of the temple and reach out for the vessel but stop short. You feel a powerful darkness emanating from the thing, and behind that, a deep sadness."
Scenario_Campaign_022_Success_3,"This artifact has been corrupted, and it seems to almost be cognizant of that fact. All of these feelings flash in your mind as a warning. It could be used for great evil. But would you fight for that evil or against it?"
Scenario_Campaign_022_Success_4,"After some effort, you use a thick cloth to get the vessel into your bag. Perhaps it would be best to bring it to an enchanter rather than mess with it yourself. "
Scenario_Campaign_023_Objective_1,Occupy all pressure plates simultaneously
Scenario_Campaign_023_Room_2_1,You fight your way through the room of machinery and find corridors heading to your left and right. 
Scenario_Campaign_023_Room_2_2,"You hear the alarm ringing from both directions. To shut it off, you may have to split up."
Scenario_Campaign_023_Success_1,"With the last switch depressed, the alarm finally, thankfully, subsides. The cannons’ lights go off and their guns point downward, lying dormant. "
Scenario_Campaign_023_Success_2,"The machinery sputters and dies, the cogs stopping their rotation. Within a matter of seconds, the entire chamber becomes as dead as it was before, leaving you to continue to explore in peace."
Scenario_Campaign_023_Success_3,"Heading down a narrow passage at the back of the left room, you find the corridor descends into a pool of brackish liquid. "
Scenario_Campaign_023_Success_4,You can see a vague light in the distance under the water. A quick swim should take you farther into this underground world.
Scenario_Campaign_024_Objective_1,Open every room
Scenario_Campaign_024_SCENARIO_MODIFIER_1,The weak sections of cave wall function identically to doors
Scenario_Campaign_024_Success_1,"The last of the fog dissipates and a wind immediately picks up, circulating throughout the chambers of the prison. Its speed grows rapidly, starting as a breeze and escalating to a cyclone in a matter of seconds."
Scenario_Campaign_024_Success_2,And then you hear the Voice: a sound carried on the wind—a great and terrible sound. There is a powerful cry and all the remaining monsters are destroyed—disintegrated and scattered among the storm.
Scenario_Campaign_024_Success_3,"“Thank you, my friends. It is good to finally be rid of those pests.” The Voice rattles your bones as it speaks. "
Scenario_Campaign_024_Success_4,"“And now that that is done, I ask you to aid me again. I am still a prisoner here, trapped in the wind. In order to take a more corporeal form and leave this land, I require my vessels of power returned to me.”"
Scenario_Campaign_024_Success_5,"You fall to your knees as the sound subsides, your head ringing from the vibration. The Voice just destroyed your adversaries as if they were nothing. You cannot imagine what it would be capable of if you were to give it more power."
Scenario_Campaign_024_Success_6,"“Do not worry, I have no desire to bring calamity to your land. I only wish to be on my way, to be free and unencumbered by this plane."" "
Scenario_Campaign_024_Success_7,"""I give you now a vision of where you can find the first vessel. They thought to hide it from me, but I can see it as if it were right in these chambers.<br><br>“Please, bring it to me.”"
Scenario_Campaign_025_Objective_1,All mercenaries must escape through the exit
Scenario_Campaign_025_Room_2_1,"You get through the wolves, thankful that the snow didn’t slow you down too much. You assume the fight is over, but the screeching begins again, this time much closer. "
Scenario_Campaign_025_Room_2_2,You look through the white storm and see red shapes scurrying toward you.
Scenario_Campaign_025_Success_1,"Everything within you wants to stop—to fall over and rest in the snow. But you know you wouldn’t get up. You know you would get torn to pieces by giant, red claws. "
Scenario_Campaign_025_Success_10,"“Or, if you wish to be cliché,” the creature says with a sigh, “you could simply attack me. Slay the dragon, save the princess, and all that."""
Scenario_Campaign_025_Success_11,"“Except I have no princess, and I’m not a dragon—just a drake who has lived a long time and does not wish to end his life today. So if you do attack me, I will fight back, and you will most assuredly die.”"
Scenario_Campaign_025_Success_2,"So you press forward, beyond all reason. Until, finally, the drakes stop pursuing and the mountain summit is in sight."
Scenario_Campaign_025_Success_3,"The wind calms as you approach the peak. It is a nice change from the torrent of biting pain that came before. The air is thin, but you are above the clouds now and so the weather is relatively peaceful."
Scenario_Campaign_025_Success_4," It makes it very easy to see the giant, winged lizard perched atop a jagged boulder."
Scenario_Campaign_025_Success_5,"“Welcome to my mountain, intrepid adventurers.” A gravelly voice booms forth from the creature, surprising you with its eloquence."
Scenario_Campaign_025_Success_6,"“I hate to back you into a corner, but now that you have come to me, face-to-face, your options are unfortunately limited."" "
Scenario_Campaign_025_Success_7,"""I am not particularly hungry at the moment, so I could be convinced to let you live, if you agree to help me in a small matter."""
Scenario_Campaign_025_Success_8,"“A group of Savvas subdued me in my sleep and removed one of my flame glands, presumably to study."""
Scenario_Campaign_025_Success_9," ""I cannot let this insult go unpunished and would greatly appreciate you taking it back from their city, killing as many of them as you can in the process.” The drake clacks its claws against its stone perch in anger."
Scenario_Campaign_026_Objective_1,Cleanse all water pumps
Scenario_Campaign_026_Room_3_1,"Following the signs of corruption, you find your way into the final room of the chamber, hoping to finish off the rest of your adversaries quickly. Instead, horror invades your mind as you view the scene before you."
Scenario_Campaign_026_Room_3_2,"Four water pipes stand vertically in the back of the room, clear conduits for the pumping of the city’s water. Attached to the pipes, however, are writhing black masses, poisoning the water running through. "
Scenario_Campaign_026_Room_3_3,"When you enter, some of the black mass drips down from the pipes, coalescing into the forms of small, bulbous imps with mouths full of teeth."
Scenario_Campaign_026_Room_3_4,"The horde of demons and undead isn’t exactly a welcome sight, either."
Scenario_Campaign_026_Success_1,"By the time the fight is over, the walls and floor are a mess of black ooze. None of it is pulsating anymore, though, which is a step in the right direction."
Scenario_Campaign_026_Success_2," A simple mop can clean the remnants, now that the dark presence has been removed."
Scenario_Campaign_026_Success_3,"You approach the back wall and bemusedly wipe away some of the grime with your finger. Most of it comes off easily, but a chalky black streak remains."
Scenario_Campaign_026_Success_4,"Curious, you take your sleeve and begin wiping the wall more vigorously, quickly revealing some sort of runic language. With enough cleaning, you find lettering covering the entire back wall."
Scenario_Campaign_026_Success_5,"The letters are unrecognizable, but you jot them down and head back to town, bringing the writings to a language expert at the University."
Scenario_Campaign_026_WaterPump,Water Pump
Scenario_Campaign_027_Objective_1,Protect Hail for ten rounds 
Scenario_Campaign_027_Objective_2,Hail must survive
Scenario_Campaign_027_Success_1,"Hail screams out with hair-raising intensity. You look to her, afraid that more demons got past you and are attacking her. "
Scenario_Campaign_027_Success_2,"Instead, you see her pulling her hand back out of the rift. Her forearm is withered and smoking. As her gnarled fingers clear the chaotic energies of the rift, it wavers and begins to shrink. "
Scenario_Campaign_027_Success_3,"A great wind picks up in the chamber and the demons fighting with you show fear for the first time. Instead of digging their claws into you, they grab at the stone floor, desperate to stop the pull of the rift."
Scenario_Campaign_027_Success_4,"Their efforts are futile, however. Every last one is sucked back into their own plane. The tear shrinks to one brilliant point and disappears."
Scenario_Campaign_027_Success_5,"Hail collapses, and you run to her side. “Oh, don’t mind me,” she coughs. “I’ll be fine. This old body has seen far worse.”"
Scenario_Campaign_027_Success_6,"She breaks into a fit of coughing, that soon turns into laughter. “That really was something, though, wasn’t it? If there’s one thing I can depend on you for, it’s a challenge."""
Scenario_Campaign_027_Success_7,"“Here, help me up. I need to get back to Gloomhaven immediately. I have many new thoughts for my research. Feel free to come by any time and I’ll figure out some way to properly thank you.”"
Scenario_Campaign_028_Start_1,"“You are worthless fodder!” The figure suddenly screams in exhilaration. “Did you think you could come back into our graces so easily?"""
Scenario_Campaign_028_Start_2,"""You are here to die! Then you can join our cause as a corpse, just like the rest of these unworthy fools!”"
Scenario_Campaign_028_Success_1,"You drop your weapons, exhausted. Thankfully, no more undead seem to be coming through the rift, but still, its existence and the presence of this Gloom is troubling."
Scenario_Campaign_028_Success_2,"“You have done well.” A cold, low voice penetrates the silence. It seems to be coming from the darkness in front of you. “My minions may not be able to forgive. But I can."" "
Scenario_Campaign_028_Success_3,“Come. Come to me. Step into my realm. Embrace the inevitable.”
Scenario_Campaign_028_Success_4,"The rift stands before you. You can see this through to the end, or you can turn around and leave this place, ignoring the call of the Gloom."
Scenario_Campaign_029_Objective_1,Destroy the doors and kill all enemies in all rooms.
Scenario_Campaign_029_Start_1,"“There will be no last stand,"" the deep voice booms. ""You will simply waste away. You will die without valor in a foreign place and there is no recourse."" "
Scenario_Campaign_029_Start_2,"""I leave you now forever. Good-bye.”"
Scenario_Campaign_029_Success_1,"You bang on the walls, desperately hoping for something to continue fighting against in this exile. You grow tired. Your vision darkens."
Scenario_Campaign_030_Objective_1,Loot the Ornate Chest with a Loot action (not end-of-turn looting)
Scenario_Campaign_030_Success_1,"You grab hold of the scepter and the entire building shudders violently. A dark energy bursts forth, piercing through the chests of the monsters still attacking you. They all fall over dead and the shuddering stops."
Scenario_Campaign_030_Success_2,"As you get back to your feet, however, a sharp pain suddenly pierces your skull. "
Scenario_Campaign_030_Success_3,"“You have been misled,” the Voice speaks into your mind. “Do not bring that scepter to me! If you free me, I guarantee no harm will come to you."" "
Scenario_Campaign_030_Success_4,"""But I cannot say the same if you approach with the scepter. Whatever you think you are doing, you are wrong.”"
Scenario_Campaign_030_Success_5,"As quickly as it came, the pain stops. You tighten your grip on the scepter and race out of the shrine, eager to bring it to the Echo Chamber and silence the Voice."
Scenario_Campaign_031_Objective_1,Destroy the rock column
Scenario_Campaign_031_RockColumn,Rock Column
Scenario_Campaign_031_Room_3_1,"Just as you are beginning to think that Hail sent you to the wrong place, you gratefully see the outline of a tower in the distance. "
Scenario_Campaign_031_Room_3_2,"The thing is massive, with twisting ropes of darkness weaving in and out of one another, reaching up through an opening in the cavern ceiling above you."
Scenario_Campaign_031_Success_1,"With one last swing, the tower of black rope severs. The strands writhe and whip around, quickly ascending out of the cave, as if falling away up into the sky. "
Scenario_Campaign_031_Success_2,"The ground shudders. Cracks form beneath your feet, and there is a loud grating noise as the whole chamber shifts and begins to crash downward."
Scenario_Campaign_032_Objective_1,Reach the back of the Harrowers' shack
Scenario_Campaign_032_Objective_2,Kill all revealed enemies 
Scenario_Campaign_032_Objective_3,Loot the vessel from the Harrowers' coffers
Scenario_Campaign_032_Success_1,"The Harrowers proved quite difficult to take down, but in the end they fell just like any other foe. "
Scenario_Campaign_032_Success_2,"Feeling the rot of the place seeping into your bones, you hurriedly ransack the dwelling and locate the small earthen pot shown to you by the Voice."
Scenario_Campaign_032_Success_3,"When you pick it up, the Voice fills your head. “Good! Yes, excellent! The infesters were but one guardian employed to block my passage. I give you now the second location. Please bring the vessels back to me. I will reward you greatly.”"
Scenario_Campaign_033_Objective_1,Loot all Ornate Chests
Scenario_Campaign_033_Objective_2,All mercenaries must escape through the exit
Scenario_Campaign_033_Room_4_1,You hear the alarm ringing clearly in the distance. You’ve kicked over a hornets’ nest and it’s just a matter of time before you are swarmed.
Scenario_Campaign_033_Room_4_2,You enter the inner chamber and scan the room. There’s a lot of treasure here. Best just to grab it all.
Scenario_Campaign_033_SCENARIO_MODIFIER_1,The door to the final room will open once all pressure plates have been activated simultaneously. 
Scenario_Campaign_033_Success_1,You round the corner just as a ball of fire flies in your direction. It explodes on the far wall and collapses the tunnel behind you. 
Scenario_Campaign_033_Success_2,"You break into a full sprint and, within minutes, emerge from the mountain and continue speeding into the surrounding foothills. "
Scenario_Campaign_034_Objective_1,Kill the Elder Drake
Scenario_Campaign_034_Success_1,"With one final blood-curdling screech, the giant drake falls off its perch and crashes to the snowy ground. It appears to still be alive, but its breaths are weak and shallow.<br>"
Scenario_Campaign_034_Success_2,"“Bloodthirsty and obtuse. I don’t know why I should have expected more,” the drake whispers. “Congratulations on your stunning success."""
Scenario_Campaign_034_Success_3,"""I’m sure you will be heralded as heroes upon your triumphant return. Adorned in crowns of gold and cloaks of silk. Riches will be laden upon you and five thousand...”"
Scenario_Campaign_034_Success_4,The drake’s whispers trail off and the breathing stops. 
Scenario_Campaign_035_Objective_1,Destroy the door
Scenario_Campaign_035_Objective_2,Kill the Captain of the Guard
Scenario_Campaign_035_Room_2_1,"As you hack away at the wooden door, an explosion erupts from it, sending gouts of flame dancing among splinters of wood and shards of rock."
Scenario_Campaign_035_Room_2_2,A shock wave blows you from your feet and you recover to see nothing but billowing smoke where the door once was. The way is clear. Now it’s time to bring down the Captain.
Scenario_Campaign_035_Start_1,“Take my place at the head of my army. Crush this wall and bring me that human’s head!”
Scenario_Campaign_035_Success_1,“Traitorous idiots!” The Captain spits blood in your face. “You’ve doomed everyone in this town! Why would you do this?”
Scenario_Campaign_035_Success_2,"A shadow is cast over his fallen body. You look to see the tall, bleeding figure of the Prime Demon standing over him. "
Scenario_Campaign_035_Success_3,"“Wealth, power, all the things you humans scrabble after every day of your miserable lives."" "
Scenario_Campaign_035_Success_4,"""These mercenaries, however, were fortunate enough to find someone who would actually give it to them instead of making empty promises."""
Scenario_Campaign_035_Success_5,“I will stay true to my word. Only those who opposed me will die. The rest are free to continue to live and toil in this place under my rule. I will return to my realm and plan my next move.”
Scenario_Campaign_036_Misc_1,"With a terrifying roar, the great demon commander leaps forward from the back ranks and lands the final blow against the old gate. It buckles and gives way under his force. "
Scenario_Campaign_036_Misc_2,"He seems winded, though, and is clearly very injured. If you can take him down, the whole attack force should be dispersed."
Scenario_Campaign_036_Objective_1,Kill the Prime Demon
Scenario_Campaign_036_Objective_2,Protect the door for 8 rounds
Scenario_Campaign_036_Start_1,“That’ll teach him!” the Captain shouts at you. “Keep them at bay! I must head to the other gates and prepare for assaults there as well.” 
Scenario_Campaign_036_Start_2,He grabs you with a firm hand. “Don’t let them through!”
Scenario_Campaign_036_Success_1,"The demon bellows and falls, shaking the earth as it crashes down. Its clawed hand opens to reveal the artifact. "
Scenario_Campaign_036_Success_2,"“I thought it would give me enough power. I thought it could sustain me on this plane. I was foolish, and now look at me. Broken and destroyed at the feet of mortals. Humiliating.” The demon gurgles and goes still."
Scenario_Campaign_036_Success_3,"The Captain steps up beside you. “The rest of the force is dispersing,” he says. “It was unpleasant, but we prevailed, thanks to you.”"
Scenario_Campaign_037_Objective_1,All mercenaries must escape through the exit
Scenario_Campaign_037_Success_1,"You press ever forward, leaving the wretched trench. Looking behind you, you see the figures of more Lurkers waiting in the shadows, but they do not pursue. Perhaps they are afraid of whatever lies ahead. "
Scenario_Campaign_037_Success_2,"You go deeper through a crack in the earth until your path shifts suddenly upwards. You emerge from the cold, unforgiving water into an air pocket deep beneath the waves. "
Scenario_Campaign_037_Success_3,"You spit out your water-breathing orb, grateful to finally breathe normally and take a short rest. Through the darkness ahead of you, you see an expansive cavern, which houses a massive stone structure. "
Scenario_Campaign_037_Success_4,"This unnatural sight, so far removed from anything you are familiar with, fills you with irrational, foreboding dread. "
Scenario_Campaign_038_Objective_1,Kill all enemies
Scenario_Campaign_038_Objective_2,Protect the Orchid 
Scenario_Campaign_038_Start_1,"“Yes, I can guide you through the deeper forest,” the Orchid says. “But I cannot abandon my brethren or let what these Inox are doing go unanswered.” He moves over to a guard’s corpse and picks up a blade."
Scenario_Campaign_038_Start_2,"""You can help me if you want, but either way, blood must be spilled in this place."" The Orchid rushes forward at a group of Inox, yelling wildly. "
Scenario_Campaign_038_Start_3,"Soon the whole camp is bustling with hostile activity. <br><br>If you want a guide, it looks as though you'll need to keep him alive. "
Scenario_Campaign_038_Success_1,"With the last of the Inox and their golems dead, the Orchid drops his sword and falls to his knees."
Scenario_Campaign_038_Success_2,"“Thank you,” he says. “They killed my family when they came. They said my children were not strong enough workers.”<br>"
Scenario_Campaign_038_Success_3,"The Orchid dips his fingers in a pool of blood and begins to paint his face with it. “I thought killing them all would help, but I still feel hollow."""
Scenario_Campaign_038_Success_4,"“I owe you a debt for what you have done. I will gladly lead you into the western forest. On the way, however, I would like to check on a neighboring Orchid village. I fear that this may not be the last of the slaving Inox tribe.”"
Scenario_Campaign_038_Success_5,"The Orchid stands and turns to you, his face now a red mask of ferocity and hatred. “I am called Redthorn. Follow me.”"
Scenario_Campaign_039_Altar,Orb Altar
Scenario_Campaign_039_Objective_1,Destroy the altar
Scenario_Campaign_039_Room_2_1,"Hoping to get the drop on anything else that may be waiting in the cave’s next chamber to attack you, you bust down the door and storm in."
Scenario_Campaign_039_Room_2_2,"There are more enemies in this cave, of course, but you are more concerned about the glowing white orb behind the crystalline demons. "
Scenario_Campaign_039_Room_2_3,"The pieces all start to fall into place. They are controlling the weather here, blocking your passage to the peak. If you can destroy the orb, you hope the punishing weather will subside."
Scenario_Campaign_039_Success_1,Pieces of the shattered orb fall to the snowy floor along with the corpses of the enemies who stood in your way. 
Scenario_Campaign_039_Success_2,The screeching of the wind outside the cave lessens to a faint murmur. You exit to see clear skies above you and a path to the peak.
Scenario_Campaign_039_Success_3,"At this altitude, without a cloud in sight, you find yourself looking out over the horizon, marveling at the wondrous expanse of mountains and the forests and plains beyond them. "
Scenario_Campaign_039_Success_4,You can even see the faint outline of Gloomhaven in the distance.
Scenario_Campaign_039_Success_5,"Looking to the west, your curiosity is piqued by a lake high in the mountains and a small stone structure resting at its edge. "
Scenario_Campaign_039_Success_6,You make a note of the building—it might be worth investigating in the future.
Scenario_Campaign_040_Objective_1,Occupy both pressure plates simultaneously
Scenario_Campaign_040_Success_1,"From opposite ends of the network, you activate the switches in the order shown to you by the Voice. As quickly as it came, the alarm subsides and the walls of the rooms open, leading you back to the entrance. "
Scenario_Campaign_040_Success_2,"There, the center of the floor slides away, revealing a narrow ladder descending down into the dark."
Scenario_Campaign_040_Success_3,"“The way to the tomb is clear,” the Voice says. “Go now, and retrieve what is mine.”"
Scenario_Campaign_041_Objective_1,All mercenaries must escape through the exit
Scenario_Campaign_041_Room_2_1,You break out of the main room into an antechamber. What was once dormant is now teeming with the living corpses of those long ago entombed here. 
Scenario_Campaign_041_Room_2_2,"And more than that, the way back to the surface is now closed off. You look around, desperate for some way to stop this situation from going from bad to worse."
Scenario_Campaign_041_Room_3_1,"You push through the unlocked door, arriving back at the tomb entrance, and your heart sinks at the sight of the narrow ladder leading up to freedom. "
Scenario_Campaign_041_Room_3_2,You will have to escape this deathtrap one at a time.
Scenario_Campaign_041_Start_1,"You grow furious at the Voice for not warning you about this extra security, and then channel that fury into doing whatever it takes to emerge from this tomb alive."
Scenario_Campaign_041_Success_1,"With the grinding sound of the golems echoing from below, you quickly climb out of the ruin. Only then does the Voice return to you."
Scenario_Campaign_041_Success_2,"“My captors were more clever than I anticipated, I’m afraid. Something blocked my influence from reaching inside the tomb."" "
Scenario_Campaign_041_Success_3,"""Luckily, you were able to navigate the dangers without my assistance. I am happy you found my prison and that you decided to be the avatars of my release. After all this time, I will finally be free."""
Scenario_Campaign_041_Success_4,"With all three vessels in hand, you make your way back to the mountain cave and into the Echo Chamber. "
Scenario_Campaign_042_Objective_1,Destroy all Vocal Chords 
Scenario_Campaign_042_SCENARIO_MODIFIER_1,Each Vocal Chord creates a unique detriment to the players until it is destroyed:
Scenario_Campaign_042_SCENARIO_MODIFIER_2,6 - All monsters add <nobr>+1 Attack <sprite name=Attack></nobr> to all their attacks.
Scenario_Campaign_042_SCENARIO_MODIFIER_3,5 - All monsters gain Advantage to all their attacks.
Scenario_Campaign_042_SCENARIO_MODIFIER_4,4 - All monsters heal 1 hit point at the start of each of their turns.
Scenario_Campaign_042_SCENARIO_MODIFIER_5,3 - All mercenaries and their summons suffer 1 damage at the start of each of their turns.
Scenario_Campaign_042_SCENARIO_MODIFIER_6,2 - All mercenaries and their summons gain Disadvantage on all their attacks.
Scenario_Campaign_042_SCENARIO_MODIFIER_7,1 - All mercenaries and their summons deduct <nobr>-1 Attack <sprite name=Attack></nobr> from all their attacks.
Scenario_Campaign_042_Start_1,"The Voice rings out again, but somehow it is different."
Scenario_Campaign_042_Start_2,“The power of the Voice is mine! You will be the first I destroy with it!”
Scenario_Campaign_042_Success_1,"A strong note of dissonance rings out as you snap the last chord, and then there is silence. "
Scenario_Campaign_042_Success_2,"Your vision fades, and you return to the Echo Chamber, now empty and still. "
Scenario_Campaign_042_Success_3,"You search the cavern for signs of the Voice, but all you find is a stone tablet covered in indecipherable foreign glyphs."
Scenario_Campaign_042_VocalChord,Vocal Chord
Scenario_Campaign_043_Objective_1,Kill a number of drakes equal to four times the number of mercenaries 
Scenario_Campaign_043_Success_1,"The waves of red-scaled lizards seem unending, but you have harvested a significant number of corpses and make a calculated retreat. "
Scenario_Campaign_043_Success_2,"At the mouth of the cave, you break into a full sprint and the drakes don't seem too interested in pursuing you. You begin the strenuous task of lugging the hides back to the Crooked Bone. "
Scenario_Campaign_044_Objective_1,Kill all enemies 
Scenario_Campaign_044_Objective_2,You lose if any Captive Orchids die
Scenario_Campaign_044_Start_1,Redthorn notches an arrow into his bow. “No Orchids will die this day!”
Scenario_Campaign_044_Success_1,"With the Inox dead, you move around the camp, untying the captive Orchids and helping them to their feet. They offer you their subdued thanks with nods of their heads."
Scenario_Campaign_044_Success_2,"“We are a reserved people,” Redthorn says as he approaches. “Don’t expect them to throw you a party, but know that you have done a monumental good here today."" "
Scenario_Campaign_044_Success_3,"""Most of these residents would have been slaughtered had we not arrived when we did.”"
Scenario_Campaign_044_Success_4,"He falls into silence with a downcast stare. “I still feel it in the pit of my stomach. I thought slaying my captors would make it go away."" "
Scenario_Campaign_044_Success_5,"""I thought saving another village would compensate for failing my own. But it doesn’t. The guilt is still there, and I have been changed by it."""
Scenario_Campaign_044_Success_6,"“This village is not my village, but even if it were, I could not stay. I no longer belong. If you need my help in the future, you can find me among the trees.”"
Scenario_Campaign_045_Objective_1,Destroy all totems 
Scenario_Campaign_045_Success_1,"You crush the last of the totems and your boots sink back into the muck. You walk over to a severely injured guard, his blood mixing with the sludge around him. "
Scenario_Campaign_045_Success_2,"You grab his collar and pull his face close to your own, interrogating him on the location of the remaining rebels."
Scenario_Campaign_045_Success_3,"“I’ll tell you,” he gasps. “But only because I know that you are not truly evil. Instead of hunting us down, fight with us. Help us take back the city from those demons."" "
Scenario_Campaign_045_Success_4,"""Head east, to the border of the Watcher Mountains. Look to the north of the ash tree grove. Talk with the commander. Help free the city...”"
Scenario_Campaign_045_Success_5,The light fades from his eyes and you drop him back down into the mud. That was easy enough.
Scenario_Campaign_045_Totem,Cleansing Totem
Scenario_Campaign_046_Objective_1,Kill the Winged Horror 
Scenario_Campaign_046_Room_3_1,"You make your way through the dark fog and find a small clearing at the summit. The screech once again pierces your ears, and a massive demon with a multitude of sharp claws and leathery wings lands before you."
Scenario_Campaign_046_Room_3_2,"""You dare approach my nest?"" You can barely make out the words from its high-pitched wailing. ""I will harvest your corpses and feed them to my children!"""
Scenario_Campaign_046_Success_1,"The giant demon screeches one last time, its timbre and intensity modulating wildly as it spasms in its death throes. Not wanting to get close to its flailing claws, you wait for the creature to expire. "
Scenario_Campaign_046_Success_2,"When it finally does, a stillness washes over the area and day once again breaks in the sky above. "
Scenario_Campaign_046_Success_3,"The view is grand, apart from the blood and carnage that litters the peak. You take it all in and then slowly begin to make your way back down the mountain, satisfied that whatever evil was lurking here will no longer trouble Gloomhaven."
Scenario_Campaign_047_Objective_1,Kill the Sightless Eye
Scenario_Campaign_047_Room_2_1,You reach the final chamber and find the horrible creature—a giant eyestalk with a gaping maw full of teeth instead of an iris.
Scenario_Campaign_047_Room_2_2,Once again you feel its influence. You begin to see the pointlessness of your actions. You understand that giving into its warm embrace is the only true course of action.
Scenario_Campaign_047_Room_2_3,"But once again you refuse. It grows angry at this, undulating its many tentacles in hostility. The room shakes violently and the corridor from which you entered begins to collapse. "
Scenario_Campaign_047_Room_2_4,"You may have resisted its maddening call, but the fight is far from over."
Scenario_Campaign_047_Success_1,"With the giant eye dead, all of its minions wither and die with it. Thankfully, the room stops shaking as well. "
Scenario_Campaign_047_Success_2,"You can’t get out the way you came in, but you are able to explore the structure further, free of the crushing dread that permeated the air previously."
Scenario_Campaign_047_Success_3,"It is a long journey, but you find your way out of the trench, return to the boat, and head back to Gloomhaven, resolving to never do something like that again."
Scenario_Campaign_048_Objective_1,Kill the Dark Rider
Scenario_Campaign_048_Success_1,"The headless spectre screams as you land one final strike against it, and its form begins to dissipate, black wisps of smoke escaping from the cracks in its armour. "
Scenario_Campaign_048_Success_2,"The giant warhose continues to stomp forward through the clearing, but it ages rapidly before your eyes. Grey hairs sprout feverishly out of its mane, and the horse shrinks as its muscles wane. "
Scenario_Campaign_048_Success_3,"Before it even reaches the edge of the clearing, the horse falls over as its brittle bones give way, and with it, an empty set of rusted armour. Within seconds, the horse and its rider are reduced to dust. "
Scenario_Campaign_049_Objective_1,Kill the Siege Cannon
Scenario_Campaign_049_Room_2_1,"Fighting through the first wave of soldiers, you arrive at a clearing. The rest of the guards are standing around a very large mechanical cannon.<br>"
Scenario_Campaign_049_Room_2_2,"“We will use this machine to destroy the walls of Gloomhaven and take back our city,” one of the guards says to you with a hard stare. “It should be able to make short work of you scum as well.”"
Scenario_Campaign_049_Room_2_3,"The cannon whirs and vibrates, glowing red hot at the end of its barrel. “It’s ready! One of the operators yells. “Get out of the way!”"
Scenario_Campaign_049_Success_1,"The cannon lies ruined and broken at your feet, and with it, any hope the rebels had of assaulting Gloomhaven. "
Scenario_Campaign_049_Success_2,"The guards who are still alive scatter, and you return to the demon-ruled Gloomhaven victorious."
Scenario_Campaign_050_Objective_1,Loot all Ornate Chests with Loot actions (not end-of-turn looting)
Scenario_Campaign_050_Success_1,You secure the last of the armory stock just as the rebel fighters break through into the fortress. Cleaning out the demons from the rest of the building becomes short work after that.
Scenario_Campaign_051_Objective_1,Kill the Gloom
Scenario_Campaign_051_Start_1,The Aesther flashes its blades in a mesmerizing dance.
Scenario_Campaign_051_Start_2,"“Come then, brave lambs. Who will be the first to embrace the Gloom?”"
Scenario_Campaign_051_Success_1,"Two swords fall to the stone floor with a sharp ring. The Aesther stands limp, a look of shock on his wounded face.<br>"
Scenario_Campaign_051_Success_2,"“How dare you,” he mutters. The voice that was once smooth and hypnotic is now gravely and dark. “I have waited thousands of years, and you presume to rob me of the fruits of my labors?”"
Scenario_Campaign_051_Success_3,"The Aesther’s mouth drops slack in death, but still the figure stands, as if held up by invisible strings."
Scenario_Campaign_051_Success_4,"“You can destroy my vessel and banish me from this plane, but it will never be enough. I am eternal. I will return. I will feast on this world once again!”"
Scenario_Campaign_051_Success_5,"At this, the body of the Aesther crumples to the ground and fades out of existence."
Scenario_Campaign_052_Objective_1,All mercenaries must loot one Ornate Chest before exhausting
Scenario_Campaign_052_Objective_2,No mercenary can exhaust before looting an Ornate Chest
Scenario_Campaign_052_Success_1,"Inside the chests, you find the pieces to a gruesome staff, adorned in maggots, with a decayed skull at its head. "
Scenario_Campaign_052_Success_2,"When you grab the last piece, another set of hidden doors slides open behind the chests. Judging that you have no choice but to take this new route, you enter."
Scenario_Campaign_052_Success_3,After a while you come upon an intersection of four paths where you rejoin your party and follow the final path back up to the surface.
Scenario_Campaign_053_Objective_1,Survive for ten rounds 
Scenario_Campaign_053_Objective_2,Prepare for a door to open
Scenario_Campaign_053_Success_1,Finally the ethereal warden finishes his work and lifts the Staff of Xorn high over his head. 
Scenario_Campaign_053_Success_2,"A powerful pulse of green light emanates through the room, reducing all remaining enemies to dust."
Scenario_Campaign_053_Success_3,The specter moves toward you and offers the staff. “Take it. Bring it to the Palace of Ice in the northern mountains and unseal the tomb of Xorn. You have done well so far. Your journey is almost over.”
Scenario_Campaign_053_Success_4,"As you grab the staff, the ghost begins to fade from view. “Thank you for allowing me to fulfill my duty, releasing me from my bonds to this realm. Now I can finally rest.”"
Scenario_Campaign_053_Success_5,"With the job complete, you quickly leave the crypt. At least the next location should be a change of scenery after all this rotten flesh and these poison-filled beasts."
Scenario_Campaign_054_Objective_1,Kill all Harrower Infesters
Scenario_Campaign_054_Objective_2,"After killing the Harrowers, end the Seeker of Xorn's turn adjacent to the altar"
Scenario_Campaign_054_Room_2_1,"In the main room, a large altar sits near the far wall. Many creatures have gathered here to protect it, however. "
Scenario_Campaign_054_Room_2_2,Foremost among them is a group of Harrower warriors. The staff pulses even stronger the closer you get to them. 
Scenario_Campaign_054_Room_2_3,It seems to hunger for their energy—to consume them and take their power for itself.
Scenario_Campaign_054_Success_1,"You place the Staff of Xorn onto the altar, and its power is sucked into the stone in a vortex of green light. The vortex grows, swallowing all of your remaining adversaries."
Scenario_Campaign_054_Success_2,"Suddenly a voice echoes through the palace: “You have returned my power, but that is not enough. I will take this body as my vessel!” "
Scenario_Campaign_054_Success_3,The vortex condenses into a sphere that hits the Seeker in the chest faster than you can react. The Seeker falls to the ground dead.
Scenario_Campaign_054_Success_4,"You rush to the corpse, only to find horrendous insects bursting out of its skin. You step back in horror as the grotesque insect horde arises and speaks. "
Scenario_Campaign_054_Success_5,“I am reborn! The plague walks the earth once more!”
Scenario_Campaign_055_Objective_1,Loot the treasure chest in the third room 
Scenario_Campaign_055_Start_1,You collect yourself and step into the unknown.
Scenario_Campaign_055_Success_1,"The fog seems to be sapping your strength as you stumble through it, one painful step at a time. "
Scenario_Campaign_055_Success_2,"Just when you think you can’t make it any farther, however, you find a hidden cache of supplies marked with the purple emblem of your quarry."
Scenario_Campaign_055_Success_3,"You quickly open the cache and find a detailed map of the area with precise instructions on navigating your way to the camp. You snatch it up and flee off into the trees, away from the fog."
Scenario_Campaign_055_Success_4,"With this map, you feel your quest is finally nearing its end."
Scenario_Campaign_056_Objective_1,Kill all enemies 
Scenario_Campaign_056_Objective_2,Protect at least one captive Orchid
Scenario_Campaign_056_Room_4_1,"You reach the main bandit encampment in a large, open clearing. Looking beyond the formidable force of enemies before you, you see a group of ragged Orchids off to one side—more victims of these monsters.<br>"
Scenario_Campaign_056_Room_4_2,"The captive Orchids notice your arrival and use the opportunity to slip out of their bonds and overwhelm one of their distracted captors. You smile, knowing your family will be avenged this day."
Scenario_Campaign_056_Room_4_3,The bandits look back and forth between you and the escaping captives in a panic. One of the guards hefts his sword and charges. “Kill them all! No one shall escape!”
Scenario_Campaign_056_Success_1,"With the last of the bandits dead, one of the surviving captives approaches your group and falls to his knees."
Scenario_Campaign_056_Success_2,"“I thank you for rescuing us,” he says quietly. “Know that my tribe will forever be your ally.”"
Scenario_Campaign_056_Success_3,"As he gathers his companions and heads off into the forest back home, you survey the carnage around you. "
Scenario_Campaign_056_Success_4,The group of bandits has indeed been eradicated and you feel relief finally knowing revenge was delivered for your village. 
Scenario_Campaign_056_Success_5,There are plenty of spoils here to help you start a new life as well—a first step towards a more secure future.
Scenario_Campaign_057_Objective_1,Kill the Infiltrator 
Scenario_Campaign_057_Room_2_1,It seems you’ve interrupted the houndmaster feeding his dogs. He doesn’t look very pleased by your intrusion.
Scenario_Campaign_057_Room_2_2,"“I guess my pets could use some fresh meat,” he grumbles, letting loose the chains."
Scenario_Campaign_057_Room_3_1,"You have found the main barracks, and as the door opens, a foreboding feeling comes over you. You recognize the lieutenant in the corner bellowing out orders. "
Scenario_Campaign_057_Room_3_2,"“Alarm! Intruders! Don’t let them get away! Slay them!” You are on the right track. Bring him to justice, then search his remains for clues."
Scenario_Campaign_057_Room_4_1,“Halt! Trespassers! What are you doing in the provision storage of the city watch?” You turn to see two guards emerge from a door behind you. 
Scenario_Campaign_057_Room_4_2,"This wasn’t what you were after, but you don’t have any time to explain. Hopefully you can dispatch the guards quickly."
Scenario_Campaign_057_Room_5_1,You interrupt a training exercise for several new recruits. The master isn’t pleased with the disruption and calls upon his trainees to practice their skills on his unwelcome guests.
Scenario_Campaign_057_Success_1,"Combing through the remains of the Infiltrator, you find a schedule to a meeting outside the city in a remote shack. There are notes about harvesting corpses. "
Scenario_Campaign_057_Success_2,"You look forward to crashing this meeting and exacting your revenge. With the spy revealed, the remaining city watch thanks you for exposing him."
Scenario_Campaign_058_BonePile,Bone Pile
Scenario_Campaign_058_Objective_1,Kill the Harvester 
Scenario_Campaign_058_Room_3_1,"As you burst through the door, you notice a strange-looking box spattered with blood. You see it holds a curved, serrated dagger that glows red."
Scenario_Campaign_058_Room_3_2,"Recalling your dead friend’s wounds, you have a strong suspicion this was the weapon that murdered him. It’s time to return the favor to its owner."
Scenario_Campaign_058_Room_4_1,"Piles of rotting bones adorned with occult glyphs greet you as you enter the back room. At the center, a malicious human figure sits on a throne of skulls. "
Scenario_Campaign_058_Room_4_2,"He stands, gathering necromantic energies from the surrounding bone piles. “I feel the desire for vengeance burning bright within your heart. I will feast well upon it!”"
Scenario_Campaign_058_Success_1,"Bloodlust is a strange thing. Once it is sated, it leaves a hollow shell of a person behind. The dagger clatters to the floor as a cold, numb feeling spreads through you. "
Scenario_Campaign_058_Success_2,"The job is done, and it is time to move on, however hard that may be."
Scenario_Campaign_059_Objective_1,Kill all enemies 
Scenario_Campaign_059_Objective_2,Loot the Ornate Chest with a Loot action (not end-of-turn looting)
Scenario_Campaign_059_Success_1,"With steely determination, you fight your way through the wild animals and reach the plant you seek at the back of the grove. "
Scenario_Campaign_059_Success_2,"When you lean down to inspect it, however, you see that the plant bears no fruit. It has been harvested very recently."
Scenario_Campaign_059_Success_3,"With confusion you glance around the grove, looking for clues to where the fruit could have gone. "
Scenario_Campaign_059_Success_4,"That’s when you see the deep axe marks in all of the trees around you. Someone chopped at the bark, not intending to cut the trees down, but only to wound them."
Scenario_Campaign_059_Success_5,Whoever it was wanted to anger the wildlife and have them viciously attack whomever came to this grove. And then you notice the faint tracks of a Quatryl in the dirt. 
Scenario_Campaign_059_Success_6,That conniving little... 
Scenario_Campaign_060_Objective_1,Loot all Ornate Chests and then all mercenaries must escape through the entrance 
Scenario_Campaign_060_Objective_2,All mercenaries must escape through the entrance 
Scenario_Campaign_060_Success_1,"You race out of the building, dodging a rain of burning debris. You barely make it through the door and clear of the structure before the whole thing collapses into a flaming mountain of rubble."
Scenario_Campaign_060_Success_2,"You cough violently, and scan the crowd once more. The Quatryl is nowhere to be found. You had no time to restrain her and now she is no doubt long gone, most likely fleeing the city."
Scenario_Campaign_060_Success_3,"It matters not. However arduous and harried the journey was, the end result is that you now have the cure necessary to save your village. It is time to leave Gloomhaven and return home."
Scenario_Campaign_060_Success_4,"Before leaving, though, you give some of the cure to the alchemists of the University. You hope that it can do some good in Gloomhaven as well."
Scenario_Campaign_061_Objective_1,Loot all Ornate Chests with a Loot action (not end-of-turn looting)
Scenario_Campaign_061_Room_5_1,You reach the fort’s center with a stack of old journals under your arm. 
Scenario_Campaign_061_Room_5_2,"Scanning the floor, you see one more book lying precariously close to a Flame Demon. You also notice, however, an altar in the middle of the room, slowly pulsing with an odd energy."
Scenario_Campaign_061_Room_5_3,"You study it for a second, realizing that it seems to be pulsing at the same frequency that the building is oscillating between planes."
Scenario_Campaign_061_Room_5_4,"Perhaps if you could destroy it, you could ground the fort in your own plane."
Scenario_Campaign_061_Success_1,"You grab the last book and then smash the altar. In a bright flash, all the monsters are sucked into another plane and the fort falls silent, no longer fading in and out."
Scenario_Campaign_061_Success_2,You gather all the books and head back down to the ground floor to study them.
Scenario_Campaign_061_Success_3,"They are mostly useless, but one of the books is exactly what you are looking for: a journal of a young girl who was in the fort when it was changed."
Scenario_Campaign_061_Success_4,"The text is old and the pages crumble, but you are able to make out some of the details. The girl, Eva, and many others fled from their city of Eastport when a horde of demons invaded."
Scenario_Campaign_061_Success_5,"She expresses some confusion over exactly where the demons came from, but the details of the many horrors she witnessed are very clear. Many of her friends were torn apart or eaten alive."
Scenario_Campaign_061_Success_6,"One of the head researchers of Eastport’s academy gathered all the survivors he could find and fled the city, hoping to hide out in this fort."
Scenario_Campaign_061_Success_7,"When it was clear that the demons had followed them and they had nowhere else to run, the researcher sent them all down to the hidden basement and attempted to perform an inter-planar ritual to save them."
Scenario_Campaign_061_Success_8,"You close the journal. He wanted to escape the demons by transporting the entire fort to another plane, but it is evident that, one way or another, the ritual went horribly wrong."
Scenario_Campaign_061_Success_9,The only thing left to do is investigate this hidden basement.
Scenario_Campaign_062_Misc_1,"As you destroy more and more of the shambling skeletons, you begin to see the faint shimmer of their souls drift toward the back of the room, where they coalesce and infuse a large pile of bones. "
Scenario_Campaign_062_Misc_2,"With enough skeletons broken and crushed, the glowing bone pile begins to vibrate and move."
Scenario_Campaign_062_Misc_3,"“You should not have come here! I continue to feast on my victims even in death, but their spirits have grown stale."" "
Scenario_Campaign_062_Misc_4,"""You wish to disturb us here? Free my prisoners from their phantasmal chains? Now those chains will bind you instead!”"
Scenario_Campaign_062_Misc_5,"Out of the pile of bones, a form begins to take shape. It is a massive collection of skulls, ribs, femurs, and others bones, which create a fearsome beast of malice."
Scenario_Campaign_062_Objective_1,Kill the Hungry Soul
Scenario_Campaign_062_Objective_2,Kill 10 Living Bones
Scenario_Campaign_062_Success_1,"With one final blow, the mass of remains blasts apart and a great burst of light shoots through the room, returning the remaining enemies to inanimate bone.<br>"
Scenario_Campaign_062_Success_2,“Thank you travelers.” A disembodied voice echoes through your head. 
Scenario_Campaign_062_Success_3,"“I tried to save these people, but instead damned them to eternal torment. You have now freed us, and we are forever grateful.”"
Scenario_Campaign_062_Success_4,"You call out to the voice, desperate to know what happened in Eastport, why the demons attacked, and where they came from."
Scenario_Campaign_062_Success_5,"“We brought this upon ourselves. In our studies, we tried to travel beyond this world, but in the end, we only managed to open a rift to a hellish nightmare. The demons came through and overwhelmed us like a rising tide."""
Scenario_Campaign_062_Success_6,"“And even in that folly, I learned nothing. I brought these people here and again unleashed powers I did not fully understand. I am so ashamed.”"
Scenario_Campaign_062_Success_7,"The voice fades from your mind. You call out to it, but there is no response. At least you have found the answers you sought, though your heart is no lighter for it."
Scenario_Campaign_063_Success_1,"The last of the Inox shrieks and collapses at your feet. Though less armoured than most Inox, this particular group made up for it with an almost otherworldly ferocity. "
Scenario_Campaign_063_Success_2,"And fighting alongside demons? The thought is truly troubling. It seems the influence of these demons is growing, and you are grateful that you have at least managed to push them back in some small way. "
Scenario_Campaign_063_Success_3,"And the treasure is nice as well, of course. You stow it in your packs and begin to make the long journey back home.  "
Scenario_Campaign_064_Success_1,"Finally, a peace falls over the cavern and you take a moment to savor the calm. You'd love to spend hours here, so far removed from the rigors and annoyances of everyday life. "
Scenario_Campaign_064_Success_2,"But the captain said he wouldn't wait long, and getting stranded here would certainly not be ideal. "
Scenario_Campaign_064_Success_3,"You take one last moment to breathe it all in, then head back through the cave and jump into the underwater tunnel. Luckily the merchant ship is still right where you left it, so you row over to its side and get hoisted back on board.  "
Scenario_Campaign_065_Objective_1,Kill all enemies 
Scenario_Campaign_065_Objective_2,Loot all Ornate Chests 
Scenario_Campaign_065_Success_1,You don't even bother reading all of the scraps of paper you find lying around the mine. You simply stuff them into your pack as you kill all the creatures that stand in your way. 
Scenario_Campaign_066_Objective_1,Occupy the pressure plate in the final room 
Scenario_Campaign_066_Room_2_1,"After traversing the entryway, you open a heavy metal door, unleashing a cacophony of whirling gears and moving machinery."
Scenario_Campaign_066_Room_2_2,"The entirety of the ancient cavern is part of some huge, intricate mechanical system that is still alive and operating deep beneath the earth."
Scenario_Campaign_066_Room_2_3,"Unfortunately, its guardians are still alive as well, and it will take more than brute force to navigate through all this chaos."
Scenario_Campaign_066_SCENARIO_MODIFIER_1,"Pressure-plate-locked doors will only stay open as long as any mercenary occupies the pressure plate in the previous room. The penultimate pressure plate will also open the two auxiliary rooms. If any mercenary moves off a pressure plate, the corresponding door will close at the end of that turn unless another corresponding plate is currently activated. Anything occupying a door when it closes suffer trap damage and are moved to the nearest unoccupied hex."
Scenario_Campaign_066_Success_1,"With the last plate activated, a massive boom echoes throughout the chamber and the gears slowly grind to a halt. "
Scenario_Campaign_066_Success_2,"Luckily, this seems to sap the power of the guardians, as well, and what was once a raucous turmoil is now eerily quiet. The gears lay dormant and the machinery no longer whirs."
Scenario_Campaign_067_Objective_1,Kill the Arcane Golem
Scenario_Campaign_067_Room_2_1,"The door nearly falls off its rusted hinges as you push against it, allowing you to make your way into a water-logged tunnel beneath the tower. "
Scenario_Campaign_067_Room_2_2,"Scanning the room, you immediately see words scratched deeply into the stone wall: “I am a monster. I am evil. I am soulless.”"
Scenario_Campaign_067_Room_3_1,"The door swings open to reveal a pristine library with a massive stone golem at its center. Surprisingly, the golem speaks in a gravelly, hard voice. "
Scenario_Campaign_067_Room_3_2,“No! Why have you come here? I have destroyed all there was to take. Why do you force me to kill?”
Scenario_Campaign_067_SCENARIO_MODIFIER_1,"The door to the third room will only remain open if the pressure plate in the second, the third room, or both are occupied by a mercenary. Anything occupying a door when it closes suffer trap damage and are moved to the nearest unoccupied hex."
Scenario_Campaign_067_SCENARIO_MODIFIER_2,The Arcane Golem cannot leave the room it is in.
Scenario_Campaign_067_Success_1,The glyphs on the golem’s limbs begin to fade and chunks of stone fall from its frame as it utters two more words: “Thank you.” 
Scenario_Campaign_067_Success_2,"Rummaging through the library, you find a journal detailing how the golem was given intelligence and the capacity to learn. "
Scenario_Campaign_067_Success_3,"What it learned, however, was that it was a soulless monster, and that it could not connect with anything else since it was commanded to never leave and to kill all intruders. "
Scenario_Campaign_067_Success_4,You also find a glowing power core inside the golem’s body.
Scenario_Campaign_068_Objective_1,Kill all enemies 
Scenario_Campaign_068_Objective_2,Protect the tree 
Scenario_Campaign_068_Success_1,"With the final creature destroyed, you are finally able to turn your attention to the tree and put out the blaze. It is heavily charred, but it should survive.<br>"
Scenario_Campaign_068_Success_2,"“I cannot thank you enough for what you have done, strangers,” the old Inox says. "
Scenario_Campaign_068_Success_3,"“I don’t know why you showed up when you did, but I believe it was the work of the spirits. You are a miracle!”"
Scenario_Campaign_068_Success_4,"The woman scratches her head. “I cannot fathom what would cause drakes to travel so far south, though. Perhaps there is something working against the spirits as well.”"
Scenario_Campaign_068_Success_5,"She hands you a couple of potions. “In any case, please take these as a token of my thanks. My tribe extracts the healing powers of the tree to make them. I hope they are of some use to you.”"
Scenario_Campaign_068_Tree,Sacred Tree
Scenario_Campaign_069_Objective_1,Pick up the Doll
Scenario_Campaign_069_Objective_2,Bring the Doll to the Well 
Scenario_Campaign_069_Success_1,"You cast the doll into the well and return to the man, who thanks you with coin."
Scenario_Campaign_070_Objective_1,Kill all demons 
Scenario_Campaign_070_Room_5_1,"You reach the back of the cave, desperately trying to stay ahead of the converging swarm of spirits behind you. Ahead of you, more powerful demons await your approach."
Scenario_Campaign_070_Room_5_2,"“There is no hope for you, fools!” The monstrous demon of violent currents speak through a howling wind. “Our army of slaves is innumerable. They will consume your flesh and add you to their ranks.”"
Scenario_Campaign_070_Success_1,"The last of the demons is destroyed, and an unearthly howling echoes throughout the room as the spirits around you slowly fade from view. "
Scenario_Campaign_070_Success_2,"You stay on guard, but the wind and anger subsides, and the cave grows peaceful. "
Scenario_Campaign_070_Success_3,You can no longer feel the overwhelming sense of dread that hung over you since you first stepped foot on the island.
Scenario_Campaign_071_Objective_1,Loot all Ornate Chests
Scenario_Campaign_071_Objective_2,All mercenaries must escape through the exit 
Scenario_Campaign_071_Success_1,"You grab what jerry root you can, and then carefully climb back down the mountain before the rest of those drakes wake up. "
Scenario_Campaign_071_Success_2,You just hope all the pain and trouble was worth it.
Scenario_Campaign_072_Objective_1,Destroy the Left Tree
Scenario_Campaign_072_Objective_2,Kill all Oozes
Scenario_Campaign_072_Objective_3,Destroy the Middle Tree
Scenario_Campaign_072_Objective_4,Destroy the Right Tree
Scenario_Campaign_072_Success_1,"The green mold covering the ground ripples and convulses as the final tree crashes to the earth. Maybe it’s your imagination, but you can almost hear it screaming.<br>"
Scenario_Campaign_072_Success_2,"Then all the slime turns brown and becomes still. You are not sure this land will ever grow crops again, but you neutralized the threat. "
Scenario_Campaign_072_Success_3,Hopefully that is enough for Greymare to hold up his end of the bargain.
Scenario_Campaign_072_Tree,Tree
Scenario_Campaign_073_Objective_1,Kill all enemies 
Scenario_Campaign_073_Objective_2,Loot all Ornate Chests 
Scenario_Campaign_073_Room_3_1,You enter the mouth of the cave and come face-to-face with an angry Inox shaman. Rocks fall from the cave's ceiling all around him. 
Scenario_Campaign_073_Room_3_2,"“Get back, city rats! This land is ours and will not be defiled! Run back down the mountain or feel our wrath!”"
Scenario_Campaign_073_Room_3_3,You smile wryly at the Inox. You didn’t climb all the way up here just to go home empty-handed.
Scenario_Campaign_073_Success_1,"With the Inox dead, you take stock of what you found in the cave's final section. "
Scenario_Campaign_073_Success_2,"It is mostly earthen pots full of ash and bits of bone, but among their belongings, you do find a large tome. "
Scenario_Campaign_073_Success_3,"It is hacked up and falling apart, but most of the pages are still readable. You carefully stow it in your pack and head back to Gloomhaven."
Scenario_Campaign_074_Objective_1,Each mercenary must loot one Ornate Chest
Scenario_Campaign_074_Objective_2,No mercenary may exhaust before looting an Ornate Chest
Scenario_Campaign_074_Room_6_1,"As you continue to plunder what you can during the fight, it becomes apparent that these aren’t just any bandits. They wear the same insignia of the bandit clan that boarded your ship. "
Scenario_Campaign_074_Room_6_2,"Unfortunately, it also becomes apparent that there are far more of them than there are of you–you won’t survive here much longer. "
Scenario_Campaign_074_Success_1,"Confident you’ve gathered as many of Gavin’s goods as you can, you decide it would be best to run for your lives. "
Scenario_Campaign_075_Objective_1,Dig up all the graves
Scenario_Campaign_075_Objective_2,Kill the Bloated Regent
Scenario_Campaign_075_Room_3_1,"You find a large, ornate sarcophagus at the back of the graveyard, and the screeching of spirits assaults your ears. "
Scenario_Campaign_075_Room_3_2,“Do not disturb the treasures of the regent! They are not for peasant hands!”
Scenario_Campaign_075_Success_1,"“Well done, indeed,” Nick marvels when you emerge from the graveyard with the stolen valuables. "
Scenario_Campaign_075_Success_2,"“It’ll take me ages to find buyers for all this old crap, but, trust me, there are plenty of people who just go crazy for this kind of stuff.”"
Scenario_Campaign_075_Success_3,He methodically goes through everything you have and then counts out a large sum of money into a hefty coin purse.
Scenario_Campaign_075_Success_4,"“Given what I expect to unload all this for, here’s your agreed upon cut. Pleasure doing business with you!”"
Scenario_Campaign_076_Objective_1,Reveal all rooms
Scenario_Campaign_076_Objective_2,Kill all enemies 
Scenario_Campaign_076_Success_1,Night Demons and animated dead—this was certainly a foul congregation of Harrowers up to no good. 
Scenario_Campaign_076_Wall,Wall
Scenario_Campaign_077_Objective_1,Loot all Ornate Chests
Scenario_Campaign_077_Objective_2,Stop all City Guards before the alarm is raised 
Scenario_Campaign_077_Room_2_1,“What in the—?” A guard moving barrels jumps up in surprise. “Intruders! Sound the alarm! Release the hounds! Power the golems! The Vigil will stand tall!”
Scenario_Campaign_077_Success_1,"Searching through the vault libraries, you find both the Codex and Dominic’s book without too much trouble. "
Scenario_Campaign_077_Success_2,"You find many other strange texts among the shelves: “Golems and Constructs,” “The Algox of the North.” "
Scenario_Campaign_077_Success_3,"There is a lot of hidden knowledge here, but there is no time to sort through it all. More of the Vigil could come down the stairs at any moment and alert the entire estate to your presence."
Scenario_Campaign_077_Success_4,"You grab what you came for and run for the exit, stepping over the corpses of the guards who stood in your way. "
Scenario_Campaign_078_Objective_1,Kill all enemies
Scenario_Campaign_078_Objective_2,Stop the sacrifice
Scenario_Campaign_078_Room_2_1,You burst through the door at the end of the hallway and see a naked man in chains kneeling in the center of the room. Around him are many figures in dark robes.
Scenario_Campaign_078_Room_2_2,“Get him up! Get him to the altar!” one of the figures yells as he moves towards the prisoner.
Scenario_Campaign_078_Room_2_3,"“The rest of you deal with these intruders. Once our dark master feeds on the innocent blood, our unwelcome guests will be destroyed by his power!”"
Scenario_Campaign_078_Success_1,"Once all the Ravens are dead, you smash the altar to pieces and free the man."
Scenario_Campaign_078_Success_2,"“Th-thank you so much,” he sobs. “I was sure I was dead. They said I was lucky, that my blood was going to be what brought their Raven god back to life."" "
Scenario_Campaign_078_Success_3,"""I thought they were referring to some kind of bird, but they kept chanting about mandibles and a carapace.”"
Scenario_Campaign_078_Success_4,"Luckily, you won’t have to find out exactly what the Ravens were trying to set free. Their corpses can join their god in permanent death."
Scenario_Campaign_079_Objective_1,Kill the Betrayer
Scenario_Campaign_079_Objective_2,Keep Fish Alive
Scenario_Campaign_079_Objective_3,Activate all of the pressure plates simultaneously to open the door
Scenario_Campaign_079_Objective_4,Kill all Stone Golems to open the door
Scenario_Campaign_079_Room_4_1,The door slides away to reveal a plain stone tomb with a large sarcophagus in the center. 
Scenario_Campaign_079_Room_4_2,"Fish runs forward and pushes away the heavy lid. “Finally, my master, you are free from your chains!” "
Scenario_Campaign_079_Room_4_3,"You look on in confusion as the stone coffin crumbles away and a black mist emerges, enveloping the duplicitous thief."
Scenario_Campaign_079_Room_4_4,"“Yessss, and now the Betrayer will consume your flesh and your soul, just as I have done in ages past!” "
Scenario_Campaign_079_Room_4_5,"Fish’s muffled screams die as the mist coalesces around him, forming into the shape of a robed Savvas. "
Scenario_Campaign_079_Room_4_6,"“They were all so easily corrupted, just as you are. The thief ’s soul was a good start, but I want yours, as well!”"
Scenario_Campaign_079_Start_1,"At this, Fish becomes exuberant. “Ah, floor triggers, friend! We each must stand on one, all at once!"" "
Scenario_Campaign_079_Start_2,"""Fish has this one, you go on ahead.” He points off into the darkness and encourages you with a wink."
Scenario_Campaign_079_Success_1,The evil Savvas screams as you hack away at its stony flesh. Black mist begins to seep out of its wounds and dissipate into the air. 
Scenario_Campaign_079_Success_2,"“My power wanes, but it will grow strong yet again. My corruption is inevitable!” "
Scenario_Campaign_079_Success_3,The Betrayer crumples into a pile of dust on the floor. 
Scenario_Campaign_079_Success_4,"Eager to be gone from this place, you gather what treasure you can find and make a hasty exit."
Scenario_Campaign_080_Objective_1,All mercenaries must loot one Ornate Chest
Scenario_Campaign_080_Objective_2,All mercenaries must escape 
Scenario_Campaign_080_Room_3_1,"Fully equipped and ready to go, you swing open the dungeon door and are greeted by sunlight and fresh air. "
Scenario_Campaign_080_Room_3_2,"Unfortunately, you are also greeted by sirens and a number of Vigil troops amassing on the bridge in front of you, intent on blocking your escape."
Scenario_Campaign_080_Room_3_3,"“Seems like now is as good a time as any to start some target practice,” an archer on the far side of the bridge yells at you, his crossbow at the ready. “Make your last seconds on this earth count!”"
Scenario_Campaign_080_Success_1,"With a trail of dead and wounded behind you, you dodge the swings of more Vigil guards and quickly climb up onto the stable’s horses. "
Scenario_Campaign_080_Success_2,"You spur them on and trample through the flimsy, wooden door."
Scenario_Campaign_081_Objective_1,Kill the Colorless
Scenario_Campaign_081_Room_3_1,"Finally reaching the entrance to the sanctum, you prepare for the last challenge. "
Scenario_Campaign_081_Room_3_2,You open the door to a place stuck between eternal darkness and blinding light. Two huge demons flank a Savvas whose chest pulses with black and golden lights. 
Scenario_Campaign_081_Room_3_3,"Savvas cannot normally master those elements, but by the look on its face, you guess that doing so drove it mad."
Scenario_Campaign_081_Success_1,"With all your strength, you drive your weapon deep into the Savvas’s chest, shattering its cores. "
Scenario_Campaign_081_Success_2,"Suddenly, the unnatural light and darkness is pulled towards the wound, gathering inside it before bursting out in a huge blast. "
Scenario_Campaign_081_Success_3,The empty body of the Savvas drops dead to the floor.
Scenario_Campaign_081_Success_4,The twilight around you returns to normal as you gather your loot and leave the temple. 
Scenario_Campaign_081_Success_5,"One last time, you stare up at the ceiling and marvel at the impossibility of this place."
Scenario_Campaign_082_ExitTile,Mercenaries that end their turn on this hex can sacrifice a looted artifact to the Beast to complete the scenario.
Scenario_Campaign_082_ItemChoice,
Scenario_Campaign_082_Objective_1,Loot the artifacts from the Ornate Chest then escape using either of the exit tiles
Scenario_Campaign_082_Objective_2,End the mercenary who looted the artifacts turn on the one-hex corridor and sacrifice one artifact to the Beast
Scenario_Campaign_082_Objective_3,Reach the entrance with all mercenaries to escape with all artifacts OR
Scenario_Campaign_082_Room_5_1,"The Savvas gathered in this back chamber as their last stand. A number of them lie around the area, their bodies mangled and roasted."
Scenario_Campaign_082_Room_5_2," A throne occupies the room’s center, and atop it sits the body of a regal Savvas holding a hammer and a helmet. "
Scenario_Campaign_082_Room_5_3,Scorched into the wall behind him are the words: “Folly. The Beast awakes. Impossible to control the Mountain’s power. Return them and it shall sleep again.”
Scenario_Campaign_082_SCENARIO_MODIFIER_1,"The two doors out of the starting room and the two doors to the final room are locked. One will open automatically whenever an elite monster is killed, beginning with the left door in the starting room followed by the right door. The two doors to the final room will then follow the same pattern. "
Scenario_Campaign_082_Success_A_1,You cast the artifact into the growing pool of liquid flame around you. It sputters and greedily engulfs the item. 
Scenario_Campaign_082_Success_A_2,"The rumbling and shaking, constant up until this point, begins to dissipate. The golems cease their movements, and the demons seem to have vanished. "
Scenario_Campaign_082_Success_A_3,"The cloud of soot still hangs in the sky as you trek back home, but the mountain seems to sleep. For now."
Scenario_Campaign_082_Success_B_1,"You burst through the stone doors, heat and ash licking at your backs. "
Scenario_Campaign_082_Success_B_2,"The shaking of the mountain reaches a crescendo as you careen down the old stone road, now splitting with fissures. "
Scenario_Campaign_082_Success_B_3,The sky has turned black and massive boulders come rumbling down the slopes. 
Scenario_Campaign_082_Success_B_4,"You barely escape back to Gloomhaven, but the volcano’s devastation is felt even there."
Scenario_Campaign_083_Misc_1,The last cultist crashes to the floor and you try to catch your breath. 
Scenario_Campaign_083_Misc_2,"Suddenly, the altar starts to tremble, smoke and fire rising from its core. "
Scenario_Campaign_083_Misc_3,Demons made of flame emerge from it and an inferno engulfs the room. 
Scenario_Campaign_083_Misc_4,You realize that you have failed to stop the ritual.
Scenario_Campaign_083_Room_3_1,"When you open the stone door, you see an altar in the middle of the room, pulsing with a strange, red energy. "
Scenario_Campaign_083_Room_3_2,"One of the cultists turns to you and lowers her cape, revealing a smile. It is the woman from the Brown Door."
Scenario_Campaign_083_Room_3_3,"“Just in time for the sacrifice,” she says as she turns to the altar. “We needed strong blood to complete our ritual.” The cultists begin chanting as you heft your weapon and charge."
Scenario_Campaign_083_Success_1,"The fire stops, and the only thing that remains on the altar is a small, glowing amber core. "
Scenario_Campaign_083_Success_2,You pick it up and it feels surprisingly cold in your hand. 
Scenario_Campaign_083_Success_3,"You are able to sell the gem for a nice profit, and you resolve to never help crying women in taverns ever again."
Scenario_Campaign_084_Objective_1,Kill all enemies 
Scenario_Campaign_084_Objective_2,Protect the crystal
Scenario_Campaign_084_SCENARIO_MODIFIER_1,"If, on any monster’s turn, it can move within range to attack the crystal, it will focus on the crystal.<br><br>Twice during the scenario, when the crystal suffers damage, any mercenary may burn one card from their hand to have it suffer no damage instead."
Scenario_Campaign_084_SCENARIO_MODIFIER_2,"The left room will reveal at the start of the fourth round, the right room at the start of the sixth round, and the top room at the start of the ninth round. "
Scenario_Campaign_084_Start_1,“My call has been answered in the nick of time.” An otherworldly voice fills the cavern.
Scenario_Campaign_084_Start_2,"“Please, they have come to destroy me. I beg for your assistance.”"
Scenario_Campaign_084_Success_1,"As the last demon falls, the earth trembles yet again and the light from the crystal fades. Terrifying noises echo throughout the chamber and you brace for more demons to attack.<br>"
Scenario_Campaign_084_Success_2,"Instead, the voice returns. “I thank you for your intervention. My meditation had gone on for much longer than expected, and the demons were hunting for me, so I sent out a shard to call for help.”"
Scenario_Campaign_084_Success_3,"Light begins to return to the cavern, and you see a glowing Orchid standing in front of you, massive crystals protruding from his head, back, and shoulders. "
Scenario_Campaign_084_Success_4,"“I know now what must happen. Please, keep the shard as a token of my thanks. You should now be able to control its power.”"
Scenario_Campaign_085_Room_5_1,"Entering the inner sanctum, you find a group of Sun Demons gathered around two altars, defending them from the last remnants of the Night Demon army.<br>"
Scenario_Campaign_085_Room_5_2,"“We thank you for distracting our foes long enough for us take this chamber,” one of the Sun Demons says. "
Scenario_Campaign_085_Room_5_3,“Now begone! We will take this temple’s power for our own and destroy all those foolish enough to stand in our way!”
Scenario_Campaign_085_Room_5_4,You are familiar enough with demons to know that handing a sacred temple over to them is a bad idea. It looks as though you will just have to destroy them all.
Scenario_Campaign_085_SCENARIO_MODIFIER_1,"Your sun-emblazoned medallion glows brightly, causing Light to become Strong and Dark to become Inert at the start of each round."
Scenario_Campaign_085_Success_1,"The last of the Sun Demons falls dim as you land one final blow, sending it to the floor."
Scenario_Campaign_085_Success_2,"“Curse you!” it spits. “With the power of the sun on this plane, we could have been immortal!” "
Scenario_Campaign_085_Success_3,And now they’re the furthest thing from immortal. Good riddance.
Scenario_Campaign_085_Success_4,"You take one last glance around the chamber, knowing you have little time left before the structure fades away, and you see a beautiful, brilliant orb rise up from one of the altars. "
Scenario_Campaign_085_Success_5,"You reach out to touch it, and the orb just feels right in your hands, as if the temple is rewarding you for keeping it safe."
Scenario_Campaign_085_Success_6,"As you pick up the orb, the walls around you fade. The ceiling becomes translucent and you can see the sun moving behind the mountain peaks in the sky above you. "
Scenario_Campaign_085_Success_7,"Before you can react, you find yourself standing outside next to the small pond, the temple nowhere in sight."
Scenario_Campaign_086_Objective_1,Allow seven villagers to escape
Scenario_Campaign_086_Objective_2,Don't allow five villagers to die
Scenario_Campaign_086_SCENARIO_MODIFIER_1,"The villagers move towards the green exit tiles with initiative 99 each round. Once reached, they are saved and removed from the map."
Scenario_Campaign_086_Success_1,"You run forward and jump onto the large fishing boat at the end of the docks as it untethers its lines and pushes out into the water. By the time the Vermlings swarm the docks, you are out in the open sea."
Scenario_Campaign_086_Success_2,"“Thank you for holding off those wretched beasts,” one of the sick passengers says. “Without you, most of us on this boat would be dead. Why are you here anyway?”"
Scenario_Campaign_086_Success_3,"You explain how you have been sent by the city guard to investigate the diseased water, and the man snorts. "
Scenario_Campaign_086_Success_4,"“Ha, as if those feckless guards could do anything helpful. We’ve been complaining to them for weeks about the water supply, and they’ve done nothing."" "
Scenario_Campaign_086_Success_5,"""For them to send someone now, it must be affecting people within Gloomhaven’s walls."""
Scenario_Campaign_086_Success_6,"“Whatever the cause, I certainly won’t turn away a well-meaning mercenary. I can lead you to the source of all these problems right now."" "
Scenario_Campaign_086_Success_7,"""We traced the poison to a small cove to the south. The foul creatures inside are pumping out an endless supply of tainted ooze into the ocean.”"
Scenario_Campaign_087_Objective_1,Kill the Giant Ooze
Scenario_Campaign_087_Room_2_1,"Battling through the Lurkers, you make your way into the main chamber of the cavern, which is dripping with a thick, putrid slime. "
Scenario_Campaign_087_Room_2_2,"At the center of the room sits a massive lump of sentient ooze, pulsating with malignant bile."
Scenario_Campaign_087_Room_2_3,"Around you, other dark creatures emerge from the muck. The mass in the center seems to be controlling them."
Scenario_Campaign_087_Room_2_4,"If you can find some way to destroy it, you may be able to end the corruption."
Scenario_Campaign_087_Success_1,"Unable to sustain itself any longer, the giant mass quivers and then loses its form, spreading its gelatinous goo all over the already slimy floor. The other creatures around you dissolve into the muck, as well."
Scenario_Campaign_087_Success_2,"You wipe the ooze from your weapons and your body, thankful that whatever cancerous evil was here has now been destroyed. "
Scenario_Campaign_087_Success_3,"Some of this poisonous liquid may still seep into the ocean, and it will take a long time for the effects of what is already there to dissipate, but at least it will not get any worse."
Scenario_Campaign_087_Success_4,"As you return to your boat, you can already see the flow of the ooze waning. You head back to Gloomhaven and report the news."
Scenario_Campaign_088_Objective_1,Kill the Lurker King
Scenario_Campaign_088_Objective_2,Bring the Lurker King's Claw to the crystal
Scenario_Campaign_088_Room_2_1,"You move into a large, open chamber and begin to feel the effects of a powerful current. "
Scenario_Campaign_088_Room_2_2,"Peering ahead, you can see a large, formidable Lurker struggling with a smaller figure. "
Scenario_Campaign_088_Room_2_3,"At your arrival, the crab-like creature looks in your direction and a chorus of aggressive claw clicking reverberates toward you through the water."
Scenario_Campaign_088_Room_2_4,The gargantuan Lurker pushes the figure up against the back wall and touches it ceremoniously with the tip of its claw. 
Scenario_Campaign_088_Room_2_5,"In a flash, the figure is encased in a cage of ice and you are finally able to recognize who it is: the Summoner. You were meant to come and save her."
Scenario_Campaign_088_Room_2_6,"Even if you have to tear off that thing’s claw and use it to dispel the ice, well, then that is exactly what you will do."
Scenario_Campaign_088_Success_1,"You touch the dead claw to the prison, and the ice vanishes. "
Scenario_Campaign_089_Success_1,"You look around at the blood-soaked floors of the assassins’ den, coming to grips with the carnage you caused.<br>"
Scenario_Campaign_089_Success_2,"“A job well done,” the Nightshroud says, silently emerging from the shadows. "
Scenario_Campaign_089_Success_3,"“I wasn’t sure you had it in you, but this is true assassin’s work. Every last one of the syndicate met their end tonight. They thought to hunt us, but we were hunting them.”"
Scenario_Campaign_089_Success_4,"He holds out a bag of gold to you. “It is only right that I share part of my commission with you. I was hired by a rival guild in the Capital to remove the Sin-Ra."" "
Scenario_Campaign_089_Success_5,"""It was never my intention to involve you, but when you mouthed off to that guard...well, I have never been one to pass up an opportunity.”"
Scenario_Campaign_089_Success_6,"You take the pouch in stunned silence. “I hope we don’t meet again,” the Nightshroud says as he walks away. “You never know what side of the contract you may end up on.”"
Scenario_Campaign_090_Misc_1,"The rift between the planes undulates wildly, expelling great gusts of wind that nearly knock you off your feet. "
Scenario_Campaign_090_Misc_2,"Within the wind, you hear the voice of the Spellweaver. “It is almost over. I will now expel the spirits holding the portal open. Destroy them and we will be victorious.”"
Scenario_Campaign_090_Objective_1,Kill all Demons to close the Rift
Scenario_Campaign_090_Objective_2,You lose if no mercenaries are alive and present in the Material Plane
Scenario_Campaign_090_Objective_3,Kill all Living Spirits to close the Rift
Scenario_Campaign_090_Objective_4,You lose if no mercenaries are alive and present in both planes
Scenario_Campaign_090_Success_1,"The rift crackles with dark energy and pulses with a chaotic aggression, fighting against its destruction. You take a step towards it and it explodes in a flash of brilliant light.<br>"
Scenario_Campaign_090_Success_2,"When your vision returns, you find yourself once again standing in a field, with the Spellweaver looking into the distance. "
Scenario_Campaign_090_Success_3,"She reaches out her hand, probing the night air with her fingers. Eventually, she is satisfied that the rift is gone and turns towards you."
Scenario_Campaign_090_Success_4,"“Thank you for your help,” she says. “I know you don’t normally work without payment."" "
Scenario_Campaign_090_Success_5,"""All I can offer you is this censer. It seems most of its power was drained closing the rift, but it should still have enough for your purposes, if not mine.”"
Scenario_Campaign_090_Success_6,You take it from her outstretched hand and she stares intently at you. “Be careful. There are many powerful and dangerous forces at work in this world.” 
Scenario_Campaign_090_Success_7,She then silently turns and walks off into the darkness.
Scenario_Campaign_091_Room_2_1,"Up ahead of you, more humans await, but your attention also turns to a disembodied, high-pitched wailing. "
Scenario_Campaign_091_Room_2_2,"""Prepare yourselves, boys,"" one of the loggers yells. ""Here comes another one!"""
Scenario_Campaign_091_Room_2_3,"You think he is talking about you until a ghostly a form materializes in front of you, all chains and volatile anger. "
Scenario_Campaign_091_Room_2_4,"It screams and thrashes around with a blind hatred for eveything near it. It, unfortunately, must be put to rest along with all these bandits. "
Scenario_Campaign_091_Start_1,"""Without the power of the spirits, I am useless,"" the Beast Tyrant says. "
Scenario_Campaign_091_Start_2,"""But I will send in my animal companions to help you. The only way to stop this plague is to kill every single one of those hairless parasites!""  "
Scenario_Campaign_091_Success_1,"The forest falls silent as the last of the loggers are killed and the spirits dissipate. No wailing, no chopping, just silence. "
Scenario_Campaign_091_Success_2,"The Beast Tyrant walks out of the underbrush with a grim look. ""It is unfortunate that the spirits had to be banished from this place, but there was no helping it,"" he says."
Scenario_Campaign_091_Success_3,"""The pain of the forest drove them mad. I hope one day this grove comes back, and with it, the means for my ancestors to find their way home."""
Scenario_Campaign_091_Success_4,"""It may be a long time before I hear their voices again, but I will stay and protect this place as best I can. I thank you for your help. Without you, I fear to think what might have happened."""
Scenario_Campaign_091_Success_5,"A number of animals gather around the Vermling as he turns and shuffles back into the forest. ""Know that you always have my support whenever you need it."""
Scenario_Campaign_092_Objective_1,Kill all non-city enemies 
Scenario_Campaign_092_Room_2_1,You round the corner of the alley and narrowly dodge a lance of fire that whizzes by your head. 
Scenario_Campaign_092_Room_2_2,"At the end of the street, a robed Savvas stands with his hands outstretched, channeling another burning projectile."
Scenario_Campaign_092_Room_2_3,You will certainly admit that you did not expect such low-rent thugs to hire a Savvas to do their dirty work. That couldn’t have come cheap.
Scenario_Campaign_092_Room_2_4,"And if that wasn’t enough, you hear the sounds of whistles behind you. It looks as though the city guards have arrived to break up the party, but these debt collectors have insulted you one too many times for you to just let this go. "
Scenario_Campaign_092_Room_2_5,This party’s not over until you say it’s over.
Scenario_Campaign_092_Success_1,"With the final thug on the ground and bleeding, you drop your weapons and raise your hands in a nonthreatening pose as more city guards arrive on the scene. "
Scenario_Campaign_092_Success_2,The captain of the squad eyes you with disappointment.
Scenario_Campaign_092_Success_3,“And what? I suppose they were the ones who started it and you were just defending yourself?”
Scenario_Campaign_092_Success_4,You open your mouth to speak when the owner of the Sleeping Lion chimes in from behind you.
Scenario_Campaign_092_Success_5,"“Aye, I saw the whole thing. Jumped they were by these foreign types. Had no choice but to put them down.”"
Scenario_Campaign_092_Success_6,"The captain’s eyes narrow to slits. “Listen, you undisciplined ruffians. I’m trying to make Gloomhaven a safe, peaceful place. I can’t have you mercenaries running around, spilling blood in the streets!"""
Scenario_Campaign_092_Success_7,"“Luckily, your friend back there is vouching for you, and your victims do indeed look like unsavory criminals, so I’m going to let you off with a warning. But if I ever catch you doing garbage like this again, so help me...”"
Scenario_Campaign_092_Success_8,"The captain trails off in a rage and then storms out of the alley, his squad close behind. The owner of the Sleeping Lion walks up and claps you on the back."
Scenario_Campaign_092_Success_9,"“Hey, I’m just happy you took the fight outside my bar this time.”"
Scenario_Campaign_093_Success_1,"The spirits seem calm and the Lurkers have retreated. You have looted what you can from the ship and are very eager to sail back to Gloomhaven to get your feet onto warm, dry land. "
Scenario_Campaign_093_Success_2,"You take one last look at the strange island and its impaled ship, then do exactly that."
Scenario_Campaign_094_Objective_1,Kill all enemies 
Scenario_Campaign_094_Objective_2,Loot the Ornate Chest 
Scenario_Campaign_094_Room_4_1,"With the screams of dying Vermlings at your back, you approach the final nest. Many more of the creatures stand before you, baring their teeth."
Scenario_Campaign_094_Room_4_2,"To the right of the nest, you see an orb of black glass on a crude stone pedestal. A deep crack runs through the glass, nearly splitting the orb in half, and you cannot help but feel you have seen it somewhere before."
Scenario_Campaign_094_Room_4_3,"Equally unnerving is how out of place the orbs look in these dirty surroundings. And why is it here, when all the other treasure is supposedly in the pit?  "
Scenario_Campaign_094_Room_4_4,You shake the questions from your mind and focus on the task at hand—killing Vermlings.
Scenario_Campaign_094_Success_1,"The Vermlings and their animal allies lie dead at your feet, and you heft the cracked orb in your hand. "
Scenario_Campaign_094_Success_2,"When you first saw it, it almost projected an aura of malevolence, but now, when you look at it up close, it seems much more mundane. "
Scenario_Campaign_094_Success_3,"Not wanting to break it, you hold it against your chest and head over to the pit where all the treasure is supposedly located."
Scenario_Campaign_095_Boulder,Boulder
Scenario_Campaign_095_Objective_1,Kill The Savvas Lavaflow
Scenario_Campaign_095_Objective_2,Loot the four keys to unlock the door
Scenario_Campaign_095_Room_4_1,"The iron bars swing wide and before you stands the antagonistic Savvas, shrouded in flame. The demons above cheer on the spectacle, hungry for more carnage. "

TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_018_4,"Choosing to <color=#FADC99><b>Long Rest</b></color> here would be certain death if the <color=#C53F3F><b>Bandit</b></color> draws an attack card for the round, as the <color=#a06e4b><b>Brute</b></color> has neither health nor cards to spare, so let's choose to <color=#FADC99><b>Short Rest</b></color>."

TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_024_2,"<color=#FADC99><b>Loot</b></color> abilities can also appear on ability cards, but the easiest way to collect it here is to end your turn on the hex that contains the gold pile.<br><br>So, let's move the <color=#a06e4b><b>Brute</b></color> onto it before the end of his turn with his remaining action!"

TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_024_4,This is where <color=#FADC99><b>default actions</b></color> come in handy!

TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_024_5,"Since you only need to <color=#FADC99><b>Move</b></color> one hex for the <color=#a06e4b><b>Brute</b></color> to reach the gold, we can skip the remaining movement using the skip button below."

Town_Records_FirstRetirement_1,"""So you want to start some sort of record of all the mercenaries who've moved on from Gloomhaven?"" the short, bearded man asks with a scowl. ""Sounds a little arrogant to me, but I'm sure I've got a spare record book somewhere in the stacks."""
Town_Records_FirstRetirement_10,"""Walls were always necessary, as were the armed men who guarded those walls. For this reason, the civilization of man grew and developed under a militaristic rule. Those skilled in warfare held the highest positions in society and governed from a perspective of keeping their charges safe from outside attacks."""
Town_Records_FirstRetirement_11,"""While this regime of strength kept the human race alive and functioning, it did stagnate the growth of other cultural facets of society. What the civilization lacked in culture, though, it made up for with rapid expansion and settlements spreading out from the north to every corner of the continent. This created a strong foothold to ensure that humans would continue to prosper and never again have to go back to hiding in caves."""
Town_Records_FirstRetirement_12,"“Best to start at the beginning, eh?” Dominic now stands before you with a small amount of leather-bound parchment. “I found this in the back — it should do well for your purposes — but I see you've found something as well.”"
Town_Records_FirstRetirement_13,"He shifts his feet a bit and hands you the parchment. “Most people see Gloomhaven as some backwoods caravan stop,” he says in an accusatory tone. “A necessary evil in the middle of a deadly wilderness. “But I disagree. I love Gloomhaven, and I believe its history needs to be documented. I think this town plays a far more important role in the history of this continent than anyone realizes, and I'm going to prove it.”"
Town_Records_FirstRetirement_14,"Dominic flashes a brief nervous smile and then grabs up the two books on the counter. “But it's not finished yet. Not by a long shot. Come back later, and I might have more history to share.”"
Town_Records_FirstRetirement_2,"He puts down his pen into the spine of the book he was inking and steps out from behind the counter at the front of the Town Records building. ""I'll be back in a bit. Don't steal anything!"""
Town_Records_FirstRetirement_3,"He gets in one more good scowl before turning and walking towards the back of the building, nearly tripping on his overly long robe multiple times. As he slips behind one of the many shelves of books, your attention shifts to the building itself."
Town_Records_FirstRetirement_4,"The Town Records building is a large, circular structure on the west side of the Coin District. Built as a status symbol for the town of wealthy merchants, anyone who actually enters can quickly see that the massive library is woefully understocked."
Town_Records_FirstRetirement_5,"Some sections, such as the teachings and philosophies of the Great Oak, are reasonably full, but many others have just a handful of books occupying long, barren shelves. Perhaps this was why some of your merchant friends were so adamant about you taking a trip to the Town Records building in the first place. Recording your party's exploits creates more content to fill these empty halls."
Town_Records_FirstRetirement_6,"With this in mind, your thoughts turn to the open book directly in front of you — the one the clerk was working on. There are two texts on the counter, and it looks as if the clerk was in the process of transcribing the writing of one into the other."
Town_Records_FirstRetirement_7,"Looking more closely, however, you notice the titles are different. The complete book is titled “The Rise of Human Civilization,” while the other is titled “The History of Gloomhaven, by Dominic Scrim.” Intrigued, you begin to read what he was writing:"
Town_Records_FirstRetirement_8,"""At some point thousands of years ago, humans stopped hiding in caves and began to form societies out in the open, erecting modest farming villages that eventually grew into the massive sprawling cities we see today."""
Town_Records_FirstRetirement_9,"""Living out in the open was never easy, though. There were wars, both amongst themselves and with other races such as the Valraths to the south. More troubling, however, were the constant raids from the more barbaric races of the world — Inox and Vermling tribes who had no concept of peace and wanted only to kill and destroy."""
Town_Records_ReachProsperity3_1,"You walk into the Town Records building and are immediately struck by how different it looks. It might just be the lighting, but there seems to be more books on the shelves and less of a scowl on Dominic's face. The short, bearded man approaches you."
Town_Records_ReachProsperity3_10,"""And so human society has certainly benefited culturally from its interaction with other races. Many of the most beautiful structures in human civilization would not be possible without the machinery of the Quatryls, the elemental mastery of the Savvas, and the architectural designs of the Valraths. The meditative Orchids have even influenced a number of human religions, though the followers of the Great Oak — a stringent group who believes a giant tree housed in the center of the capital watches over and protects everyone — remain unchanged."""
Town_Records_ReachProsperity3_11,"""And while the human military keeps the civilization alive, it is really the commerce with the other races that ultimately allows the civilization to flourish. It seems, then, as the wilds grew tamer, that a paradigm shift away from militaristic rule and towards mercantile rule was only a matter of time."""""
Town_Records_ReachProsperity3_12,"“Like I said, I'm still working on the broader strokes,” Dominic says, “but my research has been providing some interesting information. It's all very vague at the moment, though. I need to find better sources. Not just Savvas howling poems.”"
Town_Records_ReachProsperity3_13,"He takes back the book and frowns. ""Savvas write the worst poetry, and it is incredibly hard to translate.”"
Town_Records_ReachProsperity3_2,"“Ah, how good of you to come,” he says. “No doubt to record the further exploits of your friends. I was most assuredly derisive of your motives when you first walked in here, but I must say that the idea has grown on me a little.”"
Town_Records_ReachProsperity3_3,"Dominic slaps you on the back, then wanders around behind the counter. “Whether you like it or not, you are becoming important fixtures of this community. And I am sure that I have you to thank, at least in some small way, for the increased number of books lining the shelves.”"
Town_Records_ReachProsperity3_4,"He waves his arms about, his hands barely visible beneath his robe's long sleeves. “They're not good books, mind you, but they're books nonetheless."""
Town_Records_ReachProsperity3_5,"“Plus,” he says with a small smile, “I've had more time to work on my own tome."""
Town_Records_ReachProsperity3_6,"Dominic opens the small collection of parchment he has been working on and passes it to you. “I'm still focused on the big picture right now, but I should have more soon. I thought you might be interested in hearing it.”"
Town_Records_ReachProsperity3_7,"""Though human expansion has not always been greeted with kindness and civility by the other races, currently humans are more-or-less at peace with their neighbors. After a costly peace treaty with the Valraths to the south and an understanding with the prominent Inox tribes, the only main threats are the animalistic Vermlings who continue to assault human cities, sometimes for no discernible reason."""
Town_Records_ReachProsperity3_8,"""Humans have mostly stayed away from Harrower territory out of fear, and the Harrowers seem to return the favor. The same goes for the Savvas, who live underground in the largely uninhabitable mountainous regions in the north."""
Town_Records_ReachProsperity3_9,"""Orchids and Quatryls both come from far-off continents across the sea and seem far more interested in commerce and cultural exchange than conquest."""
Town_Records_ReachProsperity4_1,"""I hope we understand each other, Mister Scrim.” A well-decorated soldier stands in the center of the Town Records building as you enter. The librarian, Dominic, seems rather small by comparison, but he is not at all intimidated."
Town_Records_ReachProsperity4_10,"""Once in power, the merchant's guild quickly won the favor of the citizenry with sweeping social changes, allowing for a great many freedoms and relieving them from the heavy taxation of the military. Once the commoners were on the side of the merchants, there was little hope for the military of regaining control, at which point the mercenary army was no longer required and the military was offered a decent salary to continue keeping watch over the city."""
Town_Records_ReachProsperity4_11,"""After the capital was reformed, the Merchant's Revolution spread outward from there, quickly deposing the militaristic rule across the continent. As of the writing of this document, only one city remains under the governance of a military presence: Gloomhaven."""
Town_Records_ReachProsperity4_12,"“Next I really want to get into the development of Gloomhaven and this clash between the merchants and the military in the city,” Dominic begins, “But, as you can see, the military isn't all that happy about it.” "
Town_Records_ReachProsperity4_13,"Dominic hesitates. “I was, uh, hoping you all could do me a favor, actually. In order to continue to put my pen to paper, I think I'd better get the backing of a powerful merchant to keep me safe."""
Town_Records_ReachProsperity4_14,"“They're all sympathetic to me getting down this history, of course, but they are a little hesitant to publicly support the venture. I'm hoping you could do some convincing for me. You might have the most luck with Councilman Greymare.”"
Town_Records_ReachProsperity4_2,"“Oh, I understand you perfectly well, “ Dominic says, “but I don't think you're understanding my position. I am trying to find the truth.”"
Town_Records_ReachProsperity4_3,"The soldier looks up as you approach, then looks back down at the bearded man. “Just think about what I said.” He begins to gesture around him as he walks towards the door. “I'd hate to have to tear down this whole place.”"
Town_Records_ReachProsperity4_4,"Dominic waves at you grimly. “Hey there! Glad to see you stop by. Who knows what sort of shortsighted, lowbrow lengths that thug would have gone through to get his point across.”"
Town_Records_ReachProsperity4_5,"He shakes his head and then fluffs his beard. “It's just a difference of opinion, though. In my research, I've apparently asked the wrong people the wrong questions. It's amazing how reactionary thick-skulled people can get about what is written down on a piece of parchment."""
Town_Records_ReachProsperity4_6,"“It's not like anyone's going to even read this little text of mine.” Dominic coughs. “Um, well, except you, of course. Is that why you've come by? I've finished up the broad history if you wanted to take a look.”"
Town_Records_ReachProsperity4_7,"""As human civilization expanded across the continent, two major changes occurred. The first was that merchants grew into prominent positions within the cities due to wealth gained from lucrative trade routes both within human civilization and with other races. The second change was that the wilds, which were once so dangerous, became much less so, especially in the center of the continent, as areas were converted to farmland and peace was made with the surrounding races in one way or another."""
Town_Records_ReachProsperity4_8,"""The military taxed the trade heavily across the continent and the merchants grew more and more resentful as larger portions of their earnings were demanded for less justification. The military did nothing and grew fat off the work of others."""
Town_Records_ReachProsperity4_9,"""This all came to a head in the capital when the leader of the merchant's guild, Simon Wainwright, organized a coup of the city’s military by hiring an entire army of mercenaries with the guild’s money and taking control of the city’s keep. Very little force was actually required, as the city guard was outnumbered and woefully under-trained. The siege of the keep lasted less than two days — not nearly enough time for reinforcements to arrive from the surrounding cities."""
Town_Records_ReachProsperity5_1,Dominic trots quickly from behind the counter to meet you as you enter the Town Records building. “Just the mercenaries I wanted to see! I have something to show you.”
Town_Records_ReachProsperity5_10,"""The Valraths renounced their vicious, expansionist nature and the two races worked together to build a civilization around strength and commerce. The story of the Upheaval was only told orally, passed down from leader to leader. And many generations after the peace treaty was signed, the descendants of the two commanders began work constructing a new city as a monument to the treaty. A city built on the very spot where the Aesther told his tale. The city of Gloomhaven."""
Town_Records_ReachProsperity5_11,You look up from the book to see Dominic staring intently at you. A smile grows on his face.
Town_Records_ReachProsperity5_12,"“Right?” He says. “Surely you have the same questions I do. I mean, for starters, what was this Upheaval?”"
Town_Records_ReachProsperity5_13,"He begins pacing around the room, stumbling over his robes multiple times. “Was it some sort of catastrophe? What could the Aesther have possibly said to stop an entire war? And Gloomhaven was built on top of an ancient city? We're all aware of the ruins beneath us, but I always thought it was an earlier settlement destroyed by raiders. But the ruins predate humanity itself? Is the Upheaval what destroyed the original city?”"
Town_Records_ReachProsperity5_14,"Dominic coughs and adjusts his beard. “There are, well, too many questions. I cannot possibly continue without the answers."""
Town_Records_ReachProsperity5_15,"“I pored over all the texts from the Valrath library, but this story told by the Aesther is in none of them. The books say it was only passed down orally, but that is hard to believe. There has to be a written record somewhere.”"
Town_Records_ReachProsperity5_16,"He turns back to you and shrugs. “I may need your help in the near future, but for now I need to make more contacts and try to gather more information about where a record of the Upheaval story could possibly be. I'll send for you when I know more.”"
Town_Records_ReachProsperity5_2,"After vigorously shaking your hand, he turns and ushers you to follow as he moves toward the back room. “The texts from the southern continent finally arrived, and they have been very helpful. They've painted a much clearer picture of the Demon War.”"
Town_Records_ReachProsperity5_3,Dominic opens the back door and gestures for you to sit down in front of his open book. “I'd like you to read the latest entry and then we'll have more to talk about. There you are.”
Town_Records_ReachProsperity5_4,"""In the early years of human expansion, it was inevitable that the military would clash with the burgeoning nation of fierce Valrath to the south. Both races had a thirst for power, and this came to a head in the grassland area of Stormbrew. Both nations claimed ownership of the region and small skirmishes between settlements quickly escalated into an all-encompassing war."""
Town_Records_ReachProsperity5_5,"""The fighting raged for six years. The full attention of both civilizations bore down on these blood-soaked plains. Both races were equally fierce, stubborn, and filled with an unquenchable rage."""
Town_Records_ReachProsperity5_6,"""And after six years, the war had taken a heavy toll on both nations. With all of their resources being poured into the war, both races fell victim to numerous threats from within and from outside their borders — starvation, disease, and crime ran rampant. Before too long, both would crumble and be destroyed under the weight of the conflict."""
Town_Records_ReachProsperity5_7,"""So it came to pass, directly before what was to be one of the greatest and costliest battles between the two great commanders of the war, that an Aesther appeared between the two armies and offered a means for peace. This Aesther was the first of his kind that either of these two races had ever seen, and when he presented his offer, the commanders were terribly skeptical. In the end, however, they agreed to give the Aesther a chance."""
Town_Records_ReachProsperity5_8,"""Neither commander trusted the other or the Aesther, so when the Aesther told them to follow him to the east, both leaders brought a batallion of soldiers with them. After a few days of marching, though, a great fog rolled across the plains, and soon the two commanders were separated from their battalions. They emerged from the fog alone — just two commanders and the Aesther standing in the middle of a great ruin, an entire city of overgrown stone from a long-forgotten civilization."""
Town_Records_ReachProsperity5_9,"""Standing among the ruins, the Aesther turned and told these two commanders a story. He told them of the great Upheaval and the true history of their two races. When the story was finished, the two commanders made peace on the spot."""
Town_Records_ReachProsperity6_1,"“Ah, glad to see you got my note,” Dominic shakes your hands and then remains conspicuously quiet until you enter the back room and the door is closed and locked."
Town_Records_ReachProsperity6_2,"“I think I have the answer we're looking for,” he begins. ""I was right. There is a written record of the Aesther's story. It appears in the Codex of Directives, a book that should only be read by the highest official in each region."""
Town_Records_ReachProsperity6_3,"""There was a copy delivered to Gloomhaven. But don't worry, you won't have to raid the Ghost Fortress to get it. Because it never arrived.”"
Town_Records_ReachProsperity6_4,"Dominic looks at you intently. “It took a lot of legwork, but I eventually sniffed out a guard in town who was protecting the caravan that delivered the book from the capital many years ago. Apparently the Caravan was attacked by a group of Inox near the southern tip of the Dagger Forest."""
Town_Records_ReachProsperity6_5,"“The guard was dragged back to the Inox camp before he managed to escape and find his way to Gloomhaven. Oddly enough, no one was ever sent to find the camp and recover the caravan’s goods. They probably didn't want to incite more wrath from the Inox."""
Town_Records_ReachProsperity6_6,"“So the book may still be out there, and, with a little grease, the guard told me exactly where you can find the camp.”"
Town_Records_ReachProsperity7_1,"“Thanks for coming,” Dominic greets you at the door. “I'll keep this short. I've discovered that the Vigil is a bunch of pro military skullcrackers who feel it is their sole duty to guard against the Upheaval from happening again, but they do so by keeping any evidence of the Upheaval secret from everyone else. Seems to me like a pretty backwards way of helping.”"
Town_Records_ReachProsperity7_2,"He hands you a small piece of paper. “They operate out of the Traveler's District. Just follow the map. Listen, you don't have to kill them all if you don't want, just get back the Codex and my book.”"
Town_Records_Scenario051Complete_1,"“Well, when I said ‘breakthrough, I wasn’t expecting you to go out, find the Gloom, and destroy it,"" Dominic says as you enter the Town Records building. “Certainly nothing that extreme, but it did the trick."""
Town_Records_Scenario051Complete_10,"His smile slightly returns. “I’ll get this sent to them, and let you know if they manage to translate this final mystery…”  "
Town_Records_Scenario051Complete_2,"“I was able to study some of the writing on the walls of the chamber you found beneath the Void, and I've discovered quite a bit of information about the Gloom.”"
Town_Records_Scenario051Complete_3,"Dominic sets his book down in front of you. “If you'll permit me, I have one final entry in my history of Gloomhaven for you to read.”"
Town_Records_Scenario051Complete_4,"""The study of interplanar travel was really the brainchild of a single man: Bastian the Seeker. During his studies of what was beyond this world, an unimaginably powerful being called out to Bastian from across the infinite planes, invading and corrupting his dreams. The being promised him knowledge and power beyond what any single plane could hold. Bastian began his work to open a rift between his own plane and that of the being poisoning him as it called from beyond. He was so consumed and overtaken by greed and vice, that when the rift was finally opened and the Upheaval began, the unnameable evil was able to merge seamlessly with Bastian’s form, birthing what came to be known as the Gloom."""
Town_Records_Scenario051Complete_5,"""It has been conjectured by Aesther scholars that the evil being has no form of its own, but simply travels from plane to plane, inhabiting a vessel and using it to sow death and destruction for its own amusement. By all accounts, this being is immortal and eternal. If its vessel is destroyed, it will simply find a new one, on this plane or the next."""
Town_Records_Scenario051Complete_6,"Dominic closes the book. “I thank you for all the help you provided in the writing of this history, and I truly hope that's the last we've all seen of the Gloom.”"
Town_Records_Scenario051Complete_7,"Dominic's smile fades as he nervously fidgets with a scrap of paper. “Well, there was one last detail that gave me pause, I found some writings in the Void that I simply could not decipher. They are vaguely similar to a runic language I once encountered up north, but the exact structure is unfamiliar.” He hands the paper to you in silence."
Town_Records_Scenario051Complete_8,"You study the runes closely, but do not recognise them. You shake your head: they are meaningless to you."
Town_Records_Scenario051Complete_9,"“I had hoped you might have encountered something similar on your travels,” Dominic laments, “but I knew that chance was small. Well, I’m sure the language experts at the University would enjoy the challenge.” "
Town_Records_Scenario072Complete_1,"“Ah, my esteemed patrons!"" Dominic greets you at the door of the Town Records building. “I cannot thank you enough for securing the support of Councilman Greymare.”"
Town_Records_Scenario072Complete_10,"Dominic begins to stroke his beard. “I mean, this war happened long before Gloomhaven ever existed, so I just don't see the connection."""
Town_Records_Scenario072Complete_11,"“But I must find out. There's a much deeper story to all of this, and the Demon War has to be the key. I've requested some books from the southern Valrath libraries that I hope might shed some light on the matter, but we currently don’t have the funds to transport them. We don't have the funds for much, really.”"
Town_Records_Scenario072Complete_12,"Dominic stands from the table and walks you back towards the door. “Just keep doing what you're doing, and I'm sure some money will trickle down to me eventually.”"
Town_Records_Scenario072Complete_2,"He leads you through the half-filled shelves of books towards a small room in the back of the building. “When I heard the good news, I immediately got to work and continued my writing.”"
Town_Records_Scenario072Complete_3,"Dominic sits down at a large table in the room, his book sitting before him. He gestures you toward chairs, as well. “It still needs more detail — more research — but I am proud of it so far. Why don't you take a look at what I have? Please, read.”"
Town_Records_Scenario072Complete_4,"""Nestled in the calm waters of Merchant's Bay, Gloomhaven was founded over three hundred years ago as a harbor for trade ships traveling across the Misty Sea. Though newer than most human settlements, it expanded rapidly because of its importance as a hub of commerce for humans and other races."""
Town_Records_Scenario072Complete_5,"""Gloomhaven is integral to the human economy because it rests in the only viable spot on the eastern coastline for harboring large amounts of ships. That the town is still under military rule causes no end of aggravation to merchants across the continent. All imports and exports are heavily taxed."""
Town_Records_Scenario072Complete_6,"""The simple truth of the matter is that Gloomhaven is still a vastly dangerous city. Where other settlements have grown far safer over the course of human expansion, Gloomhaven seems to only grow more unsafe, despite countless efforts to tame the surrounding wilds. It is almost as if there is a dark presence outside the walls, bent on tearing apart the city and its citizens."""
Town_Records_Scenario072Complete_7,"""Of course, not all share this opinion. Some merchants believe that the military is actively encouraging the dangerous elements beyond the walls — inciting tribes of Vermlings to attack the city, for instance — to remind everyone that the military is necessary for Gloomhaven's survival. It may be a cynical view, but with the Merchant's Revolution toppling every other military government across the continent, it is hard to deny that the military only remains in power in Gloomhaven because of the persistent outside threats."""
Town_Records_Scenario072Complete_8,"Dominic wrings his hands. “I know. Maybe you were expecting more, but I assure you this is just the beginning."
Town_Records_Scenario072Complete_9,"“In my research, I've found a number of sources that allude to the Demon War — the war between humans and the Valraths to the south that occurred hundreds of years ago — to be one of the central causes that led to the founding of Gloomhaven, but the whole thing doesn't make much sense to me.”"
Town_Records_Scenario073Complete_1,Dominic approaches you with a sullen demeanor as you enter the Town Records building.
Town_Records_Scenario073Complete_10,"""The ruins on which you now stand were once the capital of an expansive, thriving civilization. There were no Valraths or humans, just a single race, growing and maturing in harmony with its surroundings."""
Town_Records_Scenario073Complete_11,"""In this place, ancient man had many noble pursuits. He looked into the very large expanse above us, contemplating the stars, and he also looked at the very tiny things that make up everything on this earth, The ancient man’s quest for knowledge was vast, and it stretched too far."""
Town_Records_Scenario073Complete_12,"""With great intensity, the ancient man's gaze turned to something outside this world — to the infinite planes of being that existed beyond his own. He yearned to travel to them, and to learn what he could from them."""
Town_Records_Scenario073Complete_13,"""And it was because of this desire that a rift between worlds was created, and a great calamity was brought forth. For this new plane housed not the answers to ancient man’s infinite questions, but only the creatures of nightmares — demons bent on the ruination of everything he held dear. Despite all of ancient man’s knowledge and tools, his cities and people were ravaged beyond repair. His walls turned to rubble and his family was torn apart, eaten, and driven into caves, where they huddled in the dark and waited for the end to come."""
Town_Records_Scenario073Complete_14,"""This is known as the great Upheaval..."""
Town_Records_Scenario073Complete_15,"“It's not the full thing,” Dominic says. “But it’s a start. It answers a lot of questions, but I have a lot more. I'll let you know when I have more to go on."""
Town_Records_Scenario073Complete_2,"“It feels weird seeing you after so short a time. Obviously you just delivered the Codex of Directives to me, and normally it would take longer to fully study and transcribe the Aesther's story, but...well, we have a significant problem.”"
Town_Records_Scenario073Complete_3,"As usual, you are directed to the back room, but as Dominic opens the door, you see a scene of chaos and destruction. The table is overturned and torn books are scattered across the floor. "
Town_Records_Scenario073Complete_4,"“They took everything,” Dominic sighs. “They took the Codex; they took my book... Barbarians.”"
Town_Records_Scenario073Complete_5,"He sees your confused, concerned look and continues. “They called themselves the Vigil. They said I was messing with things that I shouldn't be. They stormed in wearing full armor as I was poring over the Codex, just minutes after you left. They said they were tasked with keeping the Codex of Directives safe, and then they began looking for any copies I had made, ultimately settling on just stealing the history of Gloomhaven I was writing.”"
Town_Records_Scenario073Complete_6,Dominic slams a destroyed book down on the floor. “It's infuriating! The Vigil? Who in the name of the Oak are the Vigil? Primitives is what they are! Look at how they treated my books!”
Town_Records_Scenario073Complete_7,"Dominic closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. Eventually a small smile creeps across his face. “We do have two things going for us, though. One is that I think we are all incredibly determined to get that book back. I'm going to reach out to my contacts, maybe do a little research. I will go find out who the Vigil are and where to find them, and then I'm going to send you in to kill every last one of them."""
Town_Records_Scenario073Complete_8,“The second thing is that I have a very sharp memory. Dominic produces a crumpled scrap of paper from his robes. “I read through about half of the Aesther's story before the thugs came in swinging their swords. I think I've produced a pretty accurate transcription.”
Town_Records_Scenario073Complete_9,"""This is the story told by the Aesther Naaret to the commanders of the Demon War:"""
Town_Records_Scenario077Complete_1,"“Oh, my, you've returned!” Dominic springs up in excitement as you enter the Town Records building. He jogs toward you a  little too quickly, trips on his robe and lands flat on his face."
Town_Records_Scenario077Complete_10,"Dominic shrugs. “I'll spend some more time studying the text, but I don't know what it's going to take to find a breakthrough on this. In all the books I've read, I've never seen a single mention of this Gloom until now."""
Town_Records_Scenario077Complete_11,“I'll let you know if I find anything.”
Town_Records_Scenario077Complete_2,"“Ow. Uh, no matter,” he says waving off the incident. “I imagine you've recovered the books? Please tell me you've brought the books back!” As you nod, he jumps to his feet, smiling broadly. “Come then! It's time we got to the bottom of this — preferably in your company in case those maniacs come back.”"
Town_Records_Scenario077Complete_3,"Once in the back room, Dominic quickly opens the Codex of Directives and flips to the proper page. “Let's finish the story, shall we?”"
Town_Records_Scenario077Complete_4,"""The end did not come for the ancient man as he huddled in the darkness of his cave, insane and broken. The harbingers of the Upheaval, a great army of demons, had succeeded in bringing a once-powerful and glorious civilization to its complete and utter end. This had been a challenge, but hunting down the wretched creatures who now huddled together like rats in a cage — there was not sport in that."""
Town_Records_Scenario077Complete_5,"""The world lay shattered and ruined before them, and the Gloom grew bored, The forces withdrew and were dispatched to destroy some other world, and the Gloom decided it would be far more interesting and challenging to manipulate the wretched scraps of this ancient race into destroying themselves."""
Town_Records_Scenario077Complete_6,"""One group of ancient man, who had fled far to the south, were taken by the Gloom, their blood tainted with that of the demons’. The result was unrecognizable — a feral, animalistic race of half-demon, half-man."""
Town_Records_Scenario077Complete_7,"""And then the Gloom watched and waited. The Gloom stood silent as man emerged from his cave and began to rebuild himself. The Gloom smiled at the newfound arrogance of man as he began to expand his territories and take back the land from the unforgiving wilds. The Gloom waited for the day when its two creations met each other on the field of battle and destroyed each other completely."""
Town_Records_Scenario077Complete_8,"“The Gloom...” Dominic mumbles. “Every time I think I've gotten to the bottom of this, something new emerges.”"
Town_Records_Scenario077Complete_9,"He slumps in his chair. “This sounds bad. I guess the Aesther convinced the commanders to stop the war in order to avoid fulfilling the expectations of the Gloom, but the Vigil seem convinced that the Gloom will still return one day to destroy us all anyway. I'm not sure what to think.”"
